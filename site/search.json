Until they were eventually dwarfed by modern high-rise developments, this complex was an ominous presence that loomed over Hong Kong's lower slopes for many decades.\nCrime, Justice and Punishment in Colonial Hong Kong is a history of these three institutions through a cross section of the people, the buildings in which they found themselves, and the settings in which they pursued their various activities. Covering multiple perspectives, the people and their stories remain at the narrative’s centre, as the timeline zigzags from the colonisation of Hong Kong in 1841 to 2005–2006, when the three buildings were decommissioned.\nIn 2006, when its last occupants moved out, the Central Police Station complex began a new life as a conservation and revitalisation project under the sponsorship of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. After a period of repair and restoration, and with the addition of two new structures, the 16 existing buildings, and the compound in which they cluster, were transformed into a centre for art, heritage and leisure. A place of retribution, redemption, and death—now opened up to the public’s gaze—transformed into a space for edification and entertainment—the heritage and arts centre known as Tai Kwun.\n","id":0,"length":227,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/taikwun/"},{"content":"Architecturally, the Central Police Station, Central Magistracy and Victoria Gaol are a legacy of the British Empire. Despite adaptations to local conditions and climate, such as Chinese roof-tiles and verandas added for shade from the blistering subtropical sun, the primary architectural elements are redolent of an imperial connection—Roman doric columns, arches and pediments engraved with ‘G’ and ‘R’ on the Headquarters Block. The apparently impregnable surrounding walls, and the buildings’ intimidating massiveness, suggest something immaterial as well: this was a bastion of colonial power, a beacon flashing the unmistakable message of security, law and punishment.\n An engraving showing the north shore of Hong Kong Island, 1857.

The Magistracy and the Gaol within a surrounding wall are highlighted.    Generations of men and women were caught up in the criminal justice system. More than a million and a half predominantly Chinese went through the Central Magistracy between 1841 and 1941: thieves and murderers, kidnappers and rapists, hawkers and street boys, vagrants and drunken sailors, prostitutes and gamblers, debtors and beggars, the guilty as well as the innocent. Their lives were commemorated only when, running afoul of the law, their misdeeds were reported in the newspapers. But such memorials are no less meaningful than the monuments in stone. If buildings take precedence over people, the historian Roy Porter observed, we get heritage, not history.1\nFor decades, the public's gaze had been averted from a spot that struck onlookers as forbidding, secretive and full of misery. The forlorn wails of Gaol inmates occasionally erupting—so loud that the entire neighbourhood could hear—left no doubt that this was where suffering came to linger. Screams from those subjected to corporal punishment mingled with the ‘terrible cries’ of the lunatics, ‘who kept the whole Hospital or Gaol in an uproar’.2 Equally provocative of the dismay, revulsion or prurient fascination were the public executions that took place, first in the Magistracy compound, and from 1879 in a yard of the Gaol. Public hangings were not abolished until 1895.\n Aerial view from 1969-70 shows the Central Police Station, Central Magistracy and Victoria Prison in the midst of urban Hong Kong.   fullscreen   Aerial view from 1969-70 shows the Central Police Station, Central Magistracy and Victoria Prison in the midst of urban Hong Kong.    Pervasive in the criminal justice system in early colonial Hong Kong, racial discrimination was not so much a policy of colonial oppression as the outcome of distrust, prejudice, misunderstanding, impatience and fear, though in times of emergency it often seemed both deliberate and excessively severe. In the normal course of events, the magistrates, warders and policemen who lived and worked in these buildings would have no monuments to their memory. They were ordinary people, not personages whose names and deeds are generally perpetuated by portraits and statues. Yet they did receive a monument—in these evocative examples of Anglo-Chinese architecture that were listed for statutory protection by the Hong Kong government in 1995.\n Site overview of Taikwun   fullscreen   Site overview of Taikwun    Notes   Porter, London: A Social History, 9. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Report of the Superintendent of the Government Civil Hospital, Hongkong Government Gazette, 6 July 1878, 323. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":1,"length":541,"title":"1.

The engineer John Ouchterlony wrote about the incredible speed with which the new island settlement was built:\n With such extraordinary celerity were these building operations carried on, that, in due course of two months, the native town, Victoria, which had before presented to the eye scarcely anything but streets and rows of houses, formed of the most crazy, perishable, and inflammable materials, now boasted at least a hundred brick tenements, besides a spacious and commodious market place.’1\n Captain Arthur Cunynghame, a soldier with the British expeditionary force to China in the early 1840s, was similarly impressed:\n Perhaps no place in the history of ages can boast of such a rapid rise as the town of Hong Kong. In August, 1841, not one single house was yet built, not a portion of the brush-wood had been cleared away from this desolate spot. By June, 1842, the town was considerably more than two miles long, containing store-houses and shops, here called ‘Go-downs’, in which almost every article either Eastern or European could be procured, and most of them, at not very unreasonable prices.2\n This level of building could not have taken place, as Governor Sir John Davis recognised in 1846, ‘except for the ready command of the cheap and efficient labor of the Chinese’.3 Since there was initially not much in the way of guidance or government control, the design and construction of the buildings was often of poor quality. Chinese contractors were unfamiliar with the Western style of building and its economics, and many of them defaulted or went bankrupt, having given unrealistic quotations: ‘almost all contracts hitherto entered into with Chinamen have been obliged to be finished by Government, for the works were taken at far too low an estimate, and the consequence was, when the parties found they would become losers, both contractor and security decamped, and in some instances were imprisoned.’3 Nevertheless, great numbers of Chinese contractors persisted in the work, as an American visitor, Osmond Tiffany, observed in 1849: buildings were ‘run up and finished with magic ease; one day the cellar would be dug, and the next the roof was being finished’.4\nIn contrast to the brick tenements, the earliest buildings on the Central Police Station site, dating from the 1840s and 1850s, were constructed largely of locally sourced stone (in this case granite) and timber, materials that would have been familiar in contemporary British architecture. Found in abundance in Hong Kong, granite is a tough and durable material, particularly suited to large public and commercial buildings. Built in an adapted British architectural style, these buildings introduced a feeling of permanence to the colonial presence in Hong Kong.\n Central Police Station Barrack Block: Report and Estimate signed by Charles St George Cleverly, 1862.   fullscreen   Central Police Station Barrack Block: Report and Estimate signed by Charles St George Cleverly, 1862.    Construction of Barrack Block and Headquarters Block\nA design for the Central Police Station was soon prepared. Signed off by the Surveyor General Charles Cleverly in 1862, the plan proposed a suite of buildings that would provide all of the necessary facilities for a working police force, including living quarters, offices, stables and holding cells. One main structure nevertheless dominated all of the rest: at first referred to simply as the ‘Central Police Station’, this later became known as ‘Barrack Block’.\n European and Indian police standing in front of Barrack Block, 1890s.   fullscreen   European and Indian police standing in front of Barrack Block, 1890s.    Covering three floors, Barrack Block extended from east to west across the centre of the site and was completed in 1864. In contrast to the plain, somewhat monolithic gaol buildings, this was a relatively grand affair, developed on the same principles as a British military barracks. Its neo-classical north façade, featuring a chamfered projecting portico with a pediment at its centre, overlooked a parade ground. This was mirrored in projecting bays at either end. The façade was pierced by large, exposed granite archways on the ground floor, and by verandas on the first and second floors.\nArchitectural detailing made the verandas distinctive: this included arched openings and turned stone balusters on the first floor and rectangular openings with pilasters between, with flat stone baluster screens and timber sun screens on the second floor. Characteristic of colonial design and seen on other contemporary public buildings, these elements were all part of an architectural language that not only linked the buildings by a common aesthetic but also created a feeling of authority.\n East and north elevations of Headquarters Block, with Hollywood Road below.   fullscreen   East and north elevations of Headquarters Block, with Hollywood Road below.    Barrack Block provided billeting for 202 single constables, accommodating them in long dormitory rooms running either side of the central chamfered bay, with windows to the south and verandas to the north. The usual convention of placing verandas on the south to provide shelter from the sun was thus reversed, presumably because it would have exposed the occupants to a view of the Gaol. Cast-iron ventilation grilles in the high ceilings as well as fireplaces, which had surrounds with roundels, would have added to the occupants’ comfort in summer and winter. Timber-screen partitioning provided some division within the largest rooms, which each held a total of 32 beds. All these features, along with timber shutters to the French windows and ‘day rooms’ for relaxation, contributed a touch of domesticity. The higher-ranking sergeants had rooms in the projecting end bays on the east and west. Up to five single sergeants and the same number of married sergeants could be housed: rooms for the latter were an extra four or five feet in width to accommodate their families.\nHeadquarters Block\nDespite the new floor, the additional space was not enough, and in 1911, as a temporary measure, matsheds were erected in the parade ground north of Barrack Block. In 1913 the Governor of Hong Kong asked the Secretary of State to approve the erection of quarters for 94 Chinese and 50 Indian police, a store, an officers’ mess room, a gymnasium, and reading and rest rooms. A year later a plot of land immediately north of the existing police station site and facing Hollywood Road was resumed by the government at a cost of approximately $244,360. It already consisted of 18 terraced buildings, so the first task of the contractor, Messrs. Sang \u0026amp; Lee Co., was to demolish the buildings. By the end of 1916, these were gone and the foundations for the new building were completed. In the following year Messrs. Kien On \u0026amp; Co. began building a superstructure. The steelwork floor girders and roof trusses were imported from Lanarkshire Steel in Scotland; the project was practically at a standstill for nine months as the steel did not arrive until late in 1917. After the first consignment arrived, the erection of stanchions and girders was immediately resumed. Headquarters Block was finally completed in 1919 at a cost of $227,633.\n Well-worn flight of stairs in Headquarters Block; the banisters feature the circle-and-cross motif used extensively throughout the building.   fullscreen   Well-worn flight of stairs in Headquarters Block; the banisters feature the circle-and-cross motif used extensively throughout the building.

The Central Police Station","type":"splash","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/taikwun/2_cps/"},{"content":"Remarking on the state of crime in 1877, the Chief Justice Sir John Smale observed that Hong Kong’s police force was thicker on the ground than anywhere else in the British Empire. He attributed this to the fact that the colony received some of ‘the worst and most dangerous characters’ from its mainland neighbour, China. Six years earlier the ratio of police strength was reported to be 1 to 255 of the population, far higher than for cities such as Liverpool and Manchester.\nHong Kong remains one of the most heavily policed cities in the world. According to official figures, it had one police officer for every 256 of the population in 2016, comparable to the ratio for London and more than New York. Today the force operates from its headquarters in Wan Chai and six regional centres covering Hong Kong Island, Kowloon East, Kowloon West, New Territories North, New Territories South and ‘Marine’. For nearly a century its base was the Central Police Station on Hollywood Road, at the heart of the ‘European portion of the city’,1 according to Walter Meredith Deane, Captain Superintendent of Police in 1867–1892. From this station, its officers fanned out to keep the peace, maintain public order and cleanliness, extinguish fires, regulate traffic, apprehend illegal immigrants, counter terrorism, and, above all, prevent and detect crime. It was in the crime-fighting arena that the police in the early colony engaged most frequently with the ordinary people around them.\n   fullscreen   Chinese and Indian policeman in front of Barrack Block, c. 1890.     The history of the colonial police force is inextricably bound up with the Central Police Station. Nearly all the cases of police action began with constables and officers quartered in the Central Police Station, and ended with offenders or suspects being taken there. Our account begins with the appointment of Captain William Caine as Chief Magistrate in 1841, before the Central Police Station was established. Caine was ‘military and oriental’ in his style of enforcing the law on a population that he considered depraved and hostile. He punished lawbreakers by flogging, an expedient he claimed to have borrowed from the Qing legal code, and to prevent crime he would impose a curfew.\n   fullscreen   Watercolour painting marking the visit of China's Imperial Commissioner Qiying to Hong Kong in November 1845. William Caine is shown in a red uniform, standing second from left. Qiying is seated in the centre, with the Governor, Sir John Davis, on his left. The man standing in front is the interpreter, Karl Gutzlaff.     The approach of his successor, Charles May, if somewhat different, was also in part based on the concept of preventive policing. There was no shortage of ordinary people coming forward to report incidents of robbery, theft, assault and other crimes, but since the colonial police force initially lacked the skills for detecting crime, it fell back on preventing the commission of crime. This raises another theme: the deployment of the police force as an organ of social control. On the lookout for unsocial behaviour and public indecency, in case these might escalate into graver criminal acts, policemen were given authority to clear the streets and tenements of minor nuisances, sly brothels and unlicensed gambling dens.\nHong Kong also adopted the policy characterised as policing by ‘strangers’, a strategy found in several parts of the British Empire. From 1854 to the end of World War II, over half of the police force were recruited from outside of Hong Kong, mainly from Britain for officers and India for sergeants and constables. This inevitably created tension among the rank and file, a mutually uncomprehending group of men of diverse ethnic origins with nothing in common, least of all a shared language. To illustrate their problematic relationships, this chapter includes the stories of a number of European, Indian and Chinese constables as they went about their duties. Through the 19th century, their attempts to cope with consistently high crime rates and to control the more numerous and frequently migratory Chinese were woefully ineffective.\nA Pretty Motley Group of Roughs\n[As well as May’s ‘Hindus’,] men of every colour and stripe were to be found in the colonial police force. May called them ‘an incongruous mass’, as he listed the ethnic composition of his force:\n1st—White natives of Europe or America.\n2nd—Christian natives of Goa, Macao, and other Spanish and Portuguese settlements.\n3rd—Natives of India, mostly Mahommedan or Hindu, intermixed with coloured men from British North America, the West Indian Colonies, and the United States, Maltese, Arabs, and Malays.2\nStereotypes of the main ethnic groups were portrayed in a few ‘pungent lines’ by a Mr Small in the Hongkong Daily Press in 1871:\n They’ve given you here as ‘Guardians of the peace,’\nAn inefficient staff of mix’d police,\nA pretty motley group of roughs, I swear,\nA riff-raff, pick’d up heav’n alone knows where.\nDrunken Europeans and the lanky Sikh,\nWho cannot understand a word we speak;\nLazy Indians, too, from various tribes,\nChinese detectives who are fond of bribes—\nIn league—if all I hear be true—\nWith gamblers, thieves, and even murderers too.\nShame on the Government, a shame I say,\nTo keep such barefac’d robbers in their pay.3\n Figures showing the ethnic composition and strength of the colonial police force plucked randomly from annual reports through the late 19th and early 20th centuries disclose a policy of never allowing the local Chinese to outnumber Europeans and other ‘foreigners’. The ‘foreigners’ were usually Indians and, for a time, West Indians from Jamaica, but also would later include Northern Chinese. In 1922, a couple of years after China began negotiations for the retrocession of leased territories, and Britain prepared to withdraw from Weihaiwei in Shandong province, Governor Stubbs proposed the idea of taking on the Europeans and Chinese serving in the police. Thomas Henry King, Assistant Superintendent of Police, was duly sent to recruit 50 officers from Shandong. The first Weihaiwei contingent arrived in March 1923. They were posted to stations in the New Territories, relieving the Indians who had manned the posts.\nFurther batches of men arrived over the next nine months to boost manpower in stations in Kowloon as well as the New Territories. From 1926, increasing numbers of these northerners would form a strong contingent within the Hong Kong police force. If they were not assigned to the Emergency Unit, the Weihaiwei men were detailed to work alongside the 30 or so White Russians who formed the backbone of the Anti-Piracy Guard in the 1930s. Not only were these northerners taller (they had to be at least 5 feet 7 inches) and more rugged than the Cantonese southerners, they also spoke a different dialect and had no sense of unity with the Cantonese. They were, to all intents and purposes, as alien as any from another country. Recruitment ceased in the mid-1940s and natural wastage depleted their ranks in the 1960s. The colony’s heavy police presence was costly yet ineffective. Paying for so inept a force, the colonists grumbled, was throwing good money after bad. Much of the agonising revolved round prejudices about the attributes of men of different races and cultures, along with the question of how they would perform when put on their mettle.\nThe question was never really settled, but three arguments emerge with wearying consistency: the top command should always be English, Scottish or Irish (or ‘European’, in the nomenclature of the early colonists); for lowlier officers and the rank and file, Indians were preferred, especially since they could be fairly easily, if expensively, deployed from British India; as for the ‘natives’, their reliability was suspect. The question was: who would Chinese policemen support in the event of a clash between their compatriots and representatives of the British Crown? In the seamen’s strike of 1922, for instance, the Chinese constables and detectives apparently fraternised with the strikers; if they had done their duty, it was said, the intimidators would have been rapidly rounded up and the trouble ended in a very short time. Caught in the middle, their loyalties possibly divided, the Chinese posed too much of a risk, and could not be trusted. The historian Philip Snow says, ‘In using Indians to hold the line in Hong Kong the British were applying in all of its simple elegance their classic principle of “divide and rule”.4\nEnlisting an ethnically mixed force ‘from all quarters of the world’, Captain Superintendent Deane observed, ‘throws great obstacles in the way of efficiently employing the Force. So many prejudices of color, caste, and nationality have to be overcome . . . and so many petty internal jealousies are nurtured, that all spirit of mutual co-operation for the good of the Public is lost.’5 Not least of the obstacles was the lack of a common language between European officers and their Indian subordinates; among the constables, whether Indian or Chinese; and crucially between the policemen and the public they were supposed to protect. The police establishment always included interpreters, and more formal attempts were made from 1869 to address the language problem, starting with the establishment of a Police School.\nBut in the experience of Deane, a former cadet who spoke Chinese, a shortage of competent linguists continued to hobble the effectiveness of the force. Francis Henry May, Captain Superintendent from 1893 to 1901, admitted that at the height of the bubonic plague epidemic in 1894, the efficiency with which house-to-house visitations were accomplished owed much to the European police who could speak Chinese, and the Chinese police who could speak English. But though\n the demand for Chinese-speaking European Police was very great, I regret to say that the supply was not equal to the demand. Chinese is such an unattractive language that it is extremely difficult to induce men to take up the study of it. I have hesitated to recommend that it be made compulsory lest such a condition superadded to the low sterling value of the pay should make recruiting at home more difficult . . .6\n  Henry May, Captain Superintendent of Police, 1899.   fullscreen   Henry May, Captain Superintendent of Police, 1899.    Henry May had learned Mandarin in Peking—of little use in Hong Kong at the time—but he took it upon himself to prepare a new First Reading Book to teach English to Indian and Chinese constables. Introduced to the Police School in 1900, the reading book, with translations of the lessons in Chinese and Urdu, ‘at once took the fancy of those men who were able to read their own language’, reported the master in charge of the school. Since it was concerned principally with subjects related to police duties, ‘the book serves a most useful purpose and is of great assistance both to teachers and men’.7 Another incentive that expected to yield good results was the introduction of a scheme whereby Indians and Chinese would be granted an allowance for passing an examination in English. And for the Europeans, daily Chinese classes were instituted at all the stations.\nNotes   Report on the Police Force for 1893, Hongkong Government Gazette, 20 February 1875. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Quoted in Printed Report of Police Enquiry Commission, 20 July 1872, CO 129/158, 293. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hongkong Daily Press, 12 July 1871. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Snow, The Fall of Hong Kong (2003), 14. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Report of the Captain Superintendent of Police for 1870, Hongkong Government Gazette, 24 June 1871, 282. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Report of the Captain Superintendent of Police for 1894, Hongkong Government Gazette, 16 March 1895, 197. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Report on the Police School for 1899, Hongkong Government Gazette, 1900, 341. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":3,"length":1924,"title":"3.

Other rooms were reserved for the Chief Magistrate’s private office, witnesses and prisoners, and the usher, clerks and records. In the early days public hangings, visible from Arbuthnot Road, took place in a yard next to the building. From very early on the building was found to be inadequate. In the main court, because of the great height of the room in proportion to its length, the acoustics were so poor that all sound was lost, so that it was nearly impossible to hear the examination of witnesses even close up.1\n   fullscreen   Plan of the ground floor, produced for the additions and alterations to the Magistracy in 1857.     The Chief Magistrate, Henry Tudor Davies, complained in 1857 that proceedings were frequently disturbed by the noise of crowds collecting under the vestibule, the only place for them to gather even though it offered little protection from the sun or rain. Often there was insufficient space for prisoners in the courts: on several occasions, Davies pointed out, he had tried more than 20 prisoners in the same case—once as many as 75, and at another time 95. The building had no facilities for keeping witnesses separate from each other, and no cells for prisoners awaiting trial. Trials in the main court were constantly interrupted by clerks passing from their offices to the smaller court upstairs. Cases frequently had to be adjourned ‘on account of the supposed absence of material witnesses, when they were within the precincts of the Court, but owing to the defective accommodation not easily found; such adjournments were a serious detriment to the cause of justice, where, as in this Colony, they are immediately taken advantage of for getting up false Evidence.’2\nThe Magistrate’s Bench in the main courtroom was a mere table—semi-circular with a cloth top listed in an inventory compiled in 1861—with chairs for the Magistrate, any justices who might be present, and others considered privileged enough to sit with the Magistrate: sometimes a visiting Chinese official seeking the extradition of an alleged offender, the Attorney General or other members of the legal profession, a missionary giving evidence or the Governor on an official visit. Prominent or respectable Europeans, like Albert Smith, were also sometimes given a place beside the Magistrate, even in some cases when they were appearing as defendants. The Bench was separated from the rest of the court by railings, near to which there were tables and chairs for interpreters, the usher and the press. Members of the public were accommodated on chairs (for Europeans) and wooden benches (for others). These arrangements seem to have continued for the rest of the 19th century. A description in one of the newspapers from 1898 observed that:\n there is not a more wretchedly-lighted, ill-designed, and badly-ventilated Police Court in all the British colonies. The room is abominably dirty, the ceilings are festooned with cobwebs, and a fitting legend to place over the door of the place would be that which Dante described as adorning the portals of the nether regions. The dock is frequently crowded with prisoners, some in very advanced stages of disease and filthiness, and just about two feet away is the one solitary table that has to do duty for counsel, press and police officers. It frequently happens that there is no room in the dock for all the day’s prisoners and then the ‘overflow congregation’ is jammed in between the dock rails and the backs of the chairs of the solicitors and reporters. The close proximity of, say, twenty or thirty people taken from a fantan ‘school’ is not a comforting thing and several men of law have gone to much inconvenience rather than endure the contiguity. Then also there is the dense throng of Chinese that fill the rear part of the room. They are generally idlers of the coolie class who come to kill time, and many of them bring loud and unpleasant evidence of pulmonary troubles.11\n Generally, the article concluded, the court was ‘as badly adapted for its purposes as it can possibly be.’ Another description from the same year described it as ‘not a particularly nice place . . . and the people who frequent it are even less nice.’\n   fullscreen   The Central Magistracy, completed in 1915. This painting by Stuart Allen hangs in Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal.     In the long narrow railed-in enclosure called the dock each morning is packed the heterogeneous crowd of rogues and vagabonds, thieves, disorderly ones, gamblers and so forth that the English, Indian, and Chinese police have roped in since the Court rose on the previous day. They are young and old, many in rags that fail to cover their nakedness and many of them too are in a deplorably filthy state. A few feet away from the dock are the tables for officers, counsel, and the press representatives, and behind the dock is the place for the public. All the unemployed coolies in the Colony seem to make it their duty to fill this space each day and an unsavoury lot they are. On a warm day the atmosphere fairly reeks with the vile exudations from the crowd and the case is not improved by the constant ‘hawking’ and expectorating that goes on. As each prisoner’s case is called on he stands up in the dock, hears the evidence against him through the interpreter, says what he has to say or calls his witnesses, and if adjudged guilty the constable in charge leads him out by the queue to the little waiting room where he stays until the committal order is made out, and then he disappears behind that great iron-barred gate a few yards off. There must be an enormous illicit opium trade done in the Colony judging by the number of trays, pipes, scales and horn boxes filled with the drug that are constantly on the tables as exhibits. It is fearfully odorous at times and makes one wish to be out in the fresh air soon, especially when there happens to be a well-seasoned pipe in evidence.\nNotes   Norton-Kyshe, History, Vol. I, 236-37; Friend of China, 28 March 1849. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Davies to Bridges, 29 May 1857, CO 129/63, 307. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":4,"length":1154,"title":"4.

From the late 19th century most new laws were framed without distinction according to race. However, during the early colonial period the criminal justice system, particularly at the magistracy level, was systematically biased against Chinese and other non-Europeans. Many of Hong Kong’s early laws, explicitly or by operation, applied only to the Chinese population.\nMagistrates tended to distrust Chinese evidence, particularly where it was given against respectable Europeans. Chinese and other Asians were more likely to go to gaol for non-payment of fines. Chinese alone were subjected to flogging, exposure in the stocks, and other forms of corporal punishment. Treated as outsiders with no stake in the colony, many faced extra-judicial penalties, such as deportation, in addition to punishments imposed by magistrates and judges. When civil unrest occurred, the government enacted draconian laws which fell heavily and indiscriminately on Chinese inhabitants and usually remained on the statute books long after the crisis had subsided.\n Lithograph by Lieutenant Colonel H.D.

In the early years of British rule, punishments for certain crimes included cutting off Chinese offenders’ queues. The queue—a long plait of hair at the back of the head, worn with a half-shaven crown—was both a mark of identity, even a status symbol, among Chinese males and a sign of allegiance to Qing rule. Its absence was a sign of outlawry punishable by death. In 1842 many respectable Chinese threatened to leave the colony if this degrading punishment was not abolished. After controversy in Parliament it was discontinued as a judicial punishment. In the Gaol, long-term prisoners still had their queues cut off, but this was done on ‘health and cleanliness’ grounds, not as a punishment, and they were usually given time to regrow their hair before release.\n Sikh policmen guarding two offenders in leg stocks, 1900s.   fullscreen   Sikh policmen guarding two offenders in leg stocks, 1900s.    Some early Chinese offenders were exposed in public places in the cangue or ‘Chinese stocks’, a portable wooden board in which the head was secured, preventing the wearer from eating or moving freely. This appears to have been used in Hong Kong only in the early 1840s for certain minor offences, including failure to produce a ticket of registration. One of the first people to have been convicted by the Supreme Court, the woman Laong Kwok-shi, was sentenced in October 1844 to be exhibited monthly in the cangue, in addition to her 18-month prison sentence for kidnapping two boatwomen with the aim of selling them into prostitution. This was the only ‘Chinese punishment’ ever to be imposed by Hong Kong’s Supreme Court: the home government objected to the vague powers given to the early Supreme Court to punish Chinese offenders ‘according to the laws of China’, and instructed the Governor to remove them.\nFlogging\nIn the early 1840s the Magistracy under William Caine routinely imposed flogging on the buttocks with a rattan cane for all forms of crime committed by Chinese offenders, in addition to short prison sentences. Serious cases of piracy, robbery or burglary had to be sent to the Governor or his deputy for sentencing. In a typical case in January 1844 Governor Pottinger sentenced nine pirates each to five years’ imprisonment with hard labour, with the further direction that\n each of the prisoners shall receive 100 strokes during each year of their confinement within the 1st and 6th months on such day as the Chief Magistrate may appoint; that they shall stand in the Pillory (Cangue) for an hour on each occasion before they are flogged with labels on their breasts descriptive of their crime and sentence; that at the expiration of the full period of imprisonment they shall be turned off the island and warned if they are ever again found in the Colony they will be confined for life.1\n As the colony’s criminal justice system became more regulated, limits were imposed by legislation both on the number of strokes in each case and at each flogging (usually 36 or 50) and to the offences to which it could be applied. Practices varied over the years. In the mid-19th century offences punishable by flogging included larceny, assault, stealing from the person, being a rogue and vagabond, indecent exposure, obeying the call of nature in a public place, begging, malicious injury to property, gambling, riotous assembly, belonging to the Triad Society, returning from deportation, and other miscellaneous offences.\nIn the early 1860s, on instructions from the Colonial Office and against strong objections from officials in Hong Kong, the punishment was mainly restricted to repeat offenders, and robbery and other crimes involving violence. On 7 January 1867, for example, during a wave of violent crime, Wong Ayow, ‘calling himself a cook’, was sentenced by the Magistrate J.C. Whyte to six months’ imprisonment and two floggings for his part in a gang attack on a Chinese man near the Sing-ping Theatre on Hollywood Road, in which a hat was stolen. The next day he was led out of the Gaol ‘with a board on his chest and back stating the nature of his offence, his head clean shaved, and carrying the foxes with which he was to be lashed and the cat which would shortly cut into his back’. He was then ‘lashed to the nearest convenient lamp-post and received thirty lashes as the first instalment of his punishment’.2\nThe Magistrate Charles May insisted the punishment was necessary for a wide range of crimes. ‘It has become known to me from experience,’ he wrote, ‘that Chinese offenders have a wholesome dread of flogging, and that imprisonment is not regarded with apprehension . . . in fact corporal punishment is the only efficacious method of restraining crime.’3 By the 1870s, however, magistrates, including Charles May, were more sparing in their use of flogging. The punishment had been introduced into the Supreme Court in 1865 and continued to be widely inflicted.\n Cat-o\u0026rsquo;-nine-tails: a whip with nine lengths of knotted rope or nine leather cords.   fullscreen   Cat-o\u0026rsquo;-nine-tails: a whip with nine lengths of knotted rope or nine leather cords.    While magistrates imposed canings on the buttocks, the Supreme Court could order up to three public whippings with the cat-o’-nine-tails on the back, to a maximum of 50 lashes on each occasion (25 strokes of the rattan if the offender was under 16), in addition to a sentence of penal servitude. Forty-eight offenders received between them 4,956 lashes under this provision during the first six months of its operation. Until the government cleared the area in late 1844 to make way for European settlement, early floggings were usually carried out at a public whipping stand in the Upper Bazaar, a Chinese commercial district (centred on today’s Graham Street) close to the Magistracy.\nThe windows and balconies of the houses surrounding the whipping post were packed with spectators, male and female, who ‘seemed to consider the whole thing as quite an entertainment’. Immediately in front of the ‘post of dishonour’ a crowd of ‘high government officials, justices, barristers, naval and military officers, bankers, merchants \u0026amp;c., \u0026amp;c.’ had gathered to witness the ‘writhing and howling under the awful torture of the lash, and to count the “thuds”’. The Colonial Surgeon was in attendance to prevent the infliction of greater punishment than the men could bear, and two or three were released before they had received the assigned number of lashes. The floggings were administered by ‘four powerful fellows, who exhibited quite sufficient dexterity in the use of the whip as to justify their appointment to the position which they hold’.4\nFlogging was applied to males only. From the 1860s on, no formal distinction was made according to race. In practice, however, before World War II magistrates and judges did not sentence Europeans to flogging. The only exceptions appear to have been in 1866, when in the Supreme Court the judge Henry Ball imposed sentences of flogging on an American sailor convicted of wounding, and a Polish ex-policeman convicted of robbery from a Chinese woman. The sentences provoked outrage in the colonial community and were not carried out. Equal justice for all men was healthy enough at home, a petition on behalf of one of the men argued, but the Chinese had no conception of equal justice, and the public flogging of a European in the presence of the Chinese would bring disgrace to the whole European community.5\nBesides its use as a judicial punishment, flogging was one of several disciplinary measures available within Victoria Gaol for offences under the prison regulations such as mutiny, assault, indecent or disorderly behaviour, idleness and wilful damage. Floggings took place with far greater frequency than in prisons in England: in the five years up to July 1876, for example, over a thousand corporal punishments were imposed on prisoners in Hong Kong, compared with about 5,000 in England, which had a population 170 times the size of Hong Kong. The widespread imposition of flogging in prison and by the courts shocked the liberal-minded Governor, Sir John Pope Hennessy, when he arrived in Hong Kong in 1877. ‘As far as I am aware,’ he said, ‘there is no code of laws in any part of Her Majesty’s Empire in which the power of flogging is so extensively given to Magistrates and Judges as in Hong Kong.’ He added,\n the ostentatious marching of the prisoners half naked through the crowded streets and the public exhibition of an English turnkey flogging with a vigorous arm the speedily bleeding body of a Chinaman, tied to the whipping post, is not calculated to do much good to the groups of neglected little children who flock to see it, and to the great majority of whom this spectacle is the only lesson they receive from the civilized Government under which they have been born.6\n Hennessy abolished all flogging, except for offences for which it was available in England—for example, robbery with violence, and attempts to choke, suffocate or strangle (imposed only by the Supreme Court), and larceny by a male offender who appeared to be under the age of 16. Nevertheless, after his departure, flogging gradually crept back into the statute book for other offences, and whipping with the cat-o’-nine-tails, to which he was strongly averse, was not ended until 1954.\nNotes   Hongkong Register, 6 February 1844. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hongkong Daily Press, 8 \u0026amp; 9 January 1867.

With a few exceptions, Hong Kong’s early magistrates were not similarly qualified. At the time, a magistrate’s salary—usually £800 per annum—was insufficient to attract competent barristers from England to serve in such a remote, expensive and unhealthy colony. Later, from the 1870s to the eve of World War II, the Magistracy became a routine posting for cadet officers.\nRecruited since the 1860s from among British university graduates, cadet officers trained in the Chinese language formed the administrative class of the government, filling senior positions. Cadet-magistrates had the advantage of being able to understand the Cantonese spoken by the great majority of defendants and witnesses. Even so, proceedings were usually conducted through interpreters. From 1891, following practices in Singapore and Ceylon, cadets had priority for the position of magistrate, after passing a rudimentary law examination. Most cadets served as magistrates only for a year or two before moving to higher positions. Others, having acquired legal qualifications, became judges, even in a few cases chief justices.\n Magistrate William Caine on the occasion of the visit of the Imperial Commissioner Qiying to Hong Kong, 1845.   fullscreen   Magistrate William Caine on the occasion of the visit of the Imperial Commissioner Qiying to Hong Kong, 1845.    At various times in the 19th century the senior magistrate sat on the Legislative Council or the Executive Council, Hong Kong’s two highest councils of government. With one brief exception—the London-trained barrister Ng Choy, who served for about 12 months in 1880–1881—all of Hong Kong’s magistrates before World War II were Europeans, and all were men: the first female Magistrate, Betty Searle (who served briefly at the Central Magistracy), was not appointed until 1956. The first Magistrate, William Caine, had little formal education of any kind. On the Chinese island of Chusan, taken by the British during the First Opium War, he served from time to time as Judge-Advocate, with responsibilities for maintaining discipline among the troops, camp-followers, and the occupied population. As both Magistrate and chief of police (1841–1846) in Hong Kong, he maintained law and order during the chaotic, crime-ridden first few years of the colony.\nNg Choy\nAn interpreter of a very different calibre—Ng Choy—became the only Chinese Magistrate to serve in Hong Kong before World War II. Ng Choy (usually known outside Hong Kong as Wu Tingfang) most fully met the qualities required for the position: legal expertise, fluency in Chinese, and a knowledge of Hong Kong and its people. Born in Singapore, Ng attended missionary school in Canton and St Paul’s College in Hong Kong. After working as a translator and journalist, he became a clerk and interpreter in the Magistracy and other courts in the 1860s, and then studied law at Lincoln’s Inn in London. He was called to the Bar in 1877, and returned to Hong Kong in 1878, where he practised as the colony’s first Chinese barrister and was later appointed its first Chinese Justice of the Peace.\n Magistrate Ng Choy, ca. 1880.   fullscreen   Magistrate Ng Choy, ca. 1880.    Chinese leaders in Hong Kong adopted him as their spokesman. Europeans treated him almost as an equal. He was one of the few Chinese to be served first-class tiffin with European passengers on the Hong Kong–Canton steamer. There was, said Chief Justice Smale, ‘not a more honourable and straightforward man in Hong Kong’.1 The egalitarian Governor, Sir John Pope Hennessy, seized on Ng as a confidant and adviser on Chinese affairs. In May 1880 Hennessy appointed him both as provisional member of the Legislative Council and acting Police Magistrate, giving him permission to continue his private practice as a barrister while Magistrate—an unusual concession. Ng Choy acted as Magistrate in Hong Kong for only 12 months.\nAt a time when controversy was raging in British India over proposals to give Indian judges jurisdiction over Europeans, Ng’s appointment prompted a question from a Member of Parliament about whether it was really the case that a ‘native’ Magistrate in Hong Kong had jurisdiction to try European criminals.2 The colonial press criticised Ng for leniency in a few cases. However, his sentences did not differ much from those imposed by his various fellow Magistrates (the former policeman Charles Vandeleur Creagh, the barrister J.J. Francis, and the Gaol Superintendent Malcolm Stuart Tonnochy—the turnover was considerable at this time). Between them they dealt with larcenies, assaults, kidnappings, gambling offences, invasions of the Opium Monopoly, and the usual run of street nuisances, punishing offenders with small fines, imprisonment and the stocks: with the reforms by Governor Hennessy, flogging was not available to magistrates at this time, a fact that Ng regretted in at least one case of indecent assault.\nNg also sentenced a number of Europeans to fines or imprisonment—usually for being drunk and disorderly or rogues and vagabonds. Ng’s most serious case involving a European defendant was a charge of attempted rape made in April 1881 by a 16-year-old Chinese girl against Thomas Ide Bowler, a 30-year-old Englishman and a frequent visitor to the Magistracy, whether as complainant or defendant. Ng had to decide whether to commit Bowler for trial in the Supreme Court. The girl had agreed, through a procuress, to sell her services to Bowler and was taken to his house. But on discovering he was a foreigner she had refused to go through with it. Allegedly, Bowler had then attempted to rape her. Finding that the medical evidence obtained by the Colonial Surgeon did not support the allegations of rape and assault made by the girl, the prosecuting policeman, Inspector Cradock, withdrew the case and Bowler was discharged.3\nNg’s position near to the apex of both the colonial and Chinese worlds was precarious and short-lived. For many European colonists he was too closely associated with the unpopular Governor Hennessy, the ‘stormy petrel’ of Britain’s late-Victorian Empire, who left a trail of controversy and scandal in the colonies of which he had been Governor. The Colonial Office transferred him to Hong Kong in 1877 in the hope there would be few opportunities for mischief in this well-run and prosperous place. They were mistaken. The colonial elite resented his solicitous attention to the views of Chinese merchants—his ‘chinomania’ as some called it—which, they believed, was undermining the established order; already British business was losing ground to the rising and self-confident Chinese merchant elite. They blamed increased crime on his attempts to introduce modern penal policies, giving weight to imprisonment over flogging.\nHennessy abruptly left Hong Kong in May 1882 after a long-running scandal in which he was alleged to have attacked the leading English barrister with an umbrella.4 The Chinese leaders quickly dropped Ng, who left Hong Kong later in 1882 for Tianjin, after having speculated disastrously during a property bubble fuelled by Hennessy’s policies. Ng went on to enjoy a distinguished career as a diplomat, politician and reformer in China. As one of the commissioners for new legal codes under the late Qing, he urged unsuccessfully for the introduction of jury trials and the English system of justice. In Hong Kong, he said in a memorial to the Chinese Emperor, ‘all trials were conducted according to English law which rely strictly on evidence, without resorting to extracting confessions by torture. Yet cases were disposed of with despatch as they came before the courts, and never accumulated.’\nNotes   Hennessy to Hicks Beach, 19 January 1880, CO 129/187, 47. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Kimberley to Hennessy, 11 August 1880; Hennessy to Kimberley, 17 September 1880 (with enclosures), CO 129/191, 11-14, \u0026amp; CO 129/189, 460-70. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n China Mail, 22 April 1881. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Pope-Hennessy, Verandah, 213-28. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":6,"length":1274,"title":"6.

Many of these cases were crimes in the usual sense of the word. Thefts, burglaries and assaults of various descriptions were the most common. A much smaller number of robbery, piracy, rape and murder cases went up to the Supreme Court for trial by jury, often after committal proceedings in the Magistracy lasting several days or weeks. The majority of cases, however, were of a non-criminal nature involving offences introduced, for example, to promote cleanliness, order and decency in public places, or to protect government revenue derived from licences and monopolies.\n1928: Misconduct as a Police Officer—The Advent of the Motor Car\n Before Major C. Willson at the Central Magistracy yesterday morning P.C. Khushi Mahomed was ordered to pay the sum of $50 to the owner of the car, which as a result of his meddling took a backward plunge into the Harbour on Sunday night. As previously narrated P.C. Khushi Mahomed came across an Overland Whippet parked outside the Canton Wharf on Sunday night and as the driver had left it he took the opportunity to further his mechanical knowledge and tampered with the gears. Unfortunately, his foot must have come in contact with the electric starter and as the car had been left in the gear, the machine took a backward plunge into the Harbour. Hongkong Daily Press, 7 March 1928\n In addition to the $50 in compensation to the owner, the hapless P.C. Mahomed was also fined $50 for misconduct as a police officer, making a total of $100, equal to about four months’ pay for an Indian police constable.1 Unpleasant though the episode may have been for P.C. Mahomed, who had himself been dragged into the harbour as the car went over the seawall, the incident resulted in no lasting injuries. The punishment was a moderate one, thanks largely to the intervention of the senior police officer P.P.J. Wodehouse on Mahomed’s behalf. The police also arranged for the Overland Whippet, an American make, to be raised from the harbour. The damage, estimated at $300, was covered by insurance. Other victims of motor-car accidents that year were less fortunate. In 1928, when Hong Kong’s roads had only 2,177 licensed motor vehicles, there were 888 motor accidents, of which 39 were fatal. By the 1930s minor traffic offences were accounting for about one fifth of all magistracy cases. Most involved speeding, illegal parking, obstruction, and driving without a valid licence.\nBy 1938 the number of motor vehicles had doubled and the annual number of fatalities from road accidents had increased threefold, to 119 (two more than the 117 fatal traffic accidents recorded in 2015, when the number of licensed motor vehicles was over 100 times that in 1938). Motorists blamed poor lighting, lack of footpaths, obstructive verandas, and ‘ignorant pedestrians’ who were used to walking in the middle of the road. Occasionally drivers were prosecuted for reckless driving or manslaughter. The introduction of the motor car in Hong Kong in about 190544 had not been popular.\n Pedder Street in Hong Kong's central district bustling with pedestrians and cars, ca. 1925.   fullscreen   Pedder Street in Hong Kong's central district bustling with pedestrians and cars, ca. 1925.    Under regulations introduced in 1911, practically all of the streets of the City of Victoria were off limits to cars. The prohibited area was bounded by Queen’s Road to the north and Caine and Bonham Roads to the south, from Garden Road in the east to Pok Fu Lam Road in the west. A route along part of Hollywood Road, Lyndhurst Terrace, Wellington Street, and D’Aguilar Street down to Queen’s Road was demarcated for motor cars provided that they travelled at a speed of no more than 7 miles an hour. Cars were banned on the Peak and along Kennedy and Bowen Roads, and were restricted to speed limits of 10 miles per hour on the main roads in Victoria and up to a maximum of 20 miles per hour in other parts of the colony, including the New Territories.\nIn 1912 several prominent Chinese residents prepared a ‘monster petition’ calling for a complete ban on motor cars. The petition, rumoured to have attracted 10,000 names, was prompted by an incident in which a court interpreter, Wong Kwong Tin, was nearly knocked over by a car that had swerved from Des Voeux Road onto Wing Lok Street. The driver was fined $5 for furious driving. Instead of a ban, the government tightened traffic regulations, requiring cars to have horns and prohibiting them from being driven between midnight and 6 a.m., except for medical emergencies [. . .]\n1933: Hawking Newspapers without a Licence—Street Children\n Many Newsboys Cautioned Is this going to be a weekly habit of yours?’ said Mr Wynne-Jones at Central Magistracy yesterday when 2 girls and 18 boys, whose ages ranged from 6 to 16, were brought before him on a charge of hawking newspapers without a licence. ‘Mo faan sik’ (‘No rice to eat’) was the general reply. Sub-Inspector Carey, who prosecuted told His Worship that Chinese youngsters preferred hawking newspapers in the Colony because there were more Chinese papers here than in Canton. ‘The Hong Kong small newspapers,’ he said, can say what they like about Canton officials and the officials of China, while in Canton they regard it as hazardous.’ Most of the offenders were cautioned while several others were fined $1 or two strokes with the cane. One lad was given two strokes, but his motor bus fare is to be paid to Au Tau, his native village. Hongkong Daily Press, 18 March 1933\n Those boys and girls were among the hundreds of child hawkers and shoeblacks who made a precarious living in the streets and lanes of Central. They were familiar figures in E.I. Wynne-Jones’s court, and towards most he showed a paternal interest, albeit a stern one. The shoeblacks were partly the government’s creation. Some years earlier the Street Boys’ Club, organised by the police and housed for a while in the new Magistracy building, had enlisted the help of a number of firms selling shoe polish, which had fitted several boys out with equipment and smart red uniforms bearing the badges of the ‘Nugget’ or ‘Cherry Blossom’ brands, after the practice in London. But the numbers had got out of control and some of the boys had taken to mobbing their prospective clients. ‘They practically pull you to pieces,’ observed Wynne-Jones, though he acknowledged they were doing useful work. At times, however, his patience wore thin. In April, when dealing with a batch of 21 juvenile newspapers hawkers, he remarked that the best solution would be for him and Inspector Carey to go down to the streets, armed with a cane, ‘and thrash these lads on the spot’. Wynne-Jones sentenced those over 14 to a fine of $1 or two strokes of the cane. He then waved a cane in his hand to the others, saying, ‘I have a big Sergeant here, and I am going to let him loose on you the next time.’2\n Artist's rendering of Wynne-Jones in the Central Magistracy.

Others had run away from home in the country—in the case of one of Wynne-Jones’s boys because his father had caned him too much. Others lived with their families or relatives in cubicle or bedspace accommodation in the crowded tenements in the Western District. The churches, charitable organisations and Tung Wah Hospital offered some relief, as did the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children, which was formally inaugurated in January 1930. Every business day, between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. Chinese shops and businesses along Queen’s Road handed out leftover food after their staff had finished their evening meals. On Queen Victoria Street a line of women sold half-rotten bits of vegetables discarded from the Central Market nearby to others who were hardly less poor than they.\nThe traditional attitude of the government was that the poor were not Hong Kong’s responsibility. To provide even the minimum of assistance, it feared, would risk drawing thousands of prospective recipients from the poverty-stricken neighbouring provinces. Instead, the government either outsourced the problem through regular expulsions of beggars, or resorted to the law. Some 276 persons were brought before the Hong Kong Island magistrates for begging in 1933. Another 619 mendicants were fingerprinted and summarily deported by the police. A much larger number of people—over 6,000—were convicted of various hawking offences. Magistrates were generally sympathetic, letting many off with cautions and assisting some of the more distressing cases out of the poor box (which was replenished from time to time with the proceeds of gambling raids). Hawking vegetables and especially newspapers, they observed in their reports later in the decade, was ‘the mainstay of the child breadwinner’.3\nNotes   Hong Kong Daily Press, 5 March 1928; South China Morning Post, 7 March 1928. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Report of the Director of Public Works for 1899, Sessional Papers 1900, 238. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Prisons Department Annual Report for 1938, Administrative Report 1938, L2. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":7,"length":1596,"title":"7.

Only the southern half of the Gaol, shown at the top of this plan, was built.    By 1861 the Gaol had deteriorated into ‘a den in which men were dealt with as beasts’.3 A new radial-plan gaol was then constructed, opening to great acclaim in 1866: the China Mail thought it ‘the finest prison establishment on this side of India, possibly of the Cape’; indeed, it might be safely said that ‘our prison is one of the most complete and best conducted that exists in any part of the world’.4 Guo Songtao, the Chinese envoy, remarked after a visit in 1876 that the Gaol was so clean ‘one forgot that this was a prison’.5 Nine years on, a gaol superintendent—denied the facilities to hold prisoners in separate cells—was provoked into saying: ‘Victoria Gaol is unsuited to the demands of modern civilization, or even humanity . . . it seems hardly humane to continue a Prison system in which the enforced association of criminals is well known as tending the make the better class bad and the bad worse.’6\n When first constructed, the radial-plan Victoria Goal had a Chinese-style pitched roof covered with overlapping tiles.

In 1893 leading members of the Chinese community took issue with plans to improve prison conditions, for the Gaol was so comfortable, they said, that it was already ‘looked upon as a paradise by many a rascal’.7 The writer Ai Wu, deported from Burma back to China via Hong Kong in 1931, spent a night in Victoria Gaol; in an essay he wrote afterwards, he recalled the acrid stench of ordure and disinfectant in his cell.8\nThese quotations resonate with a whole range of images and meanings that are not only forcefully suggestive of the terrible ordeal of confinement, but also the shifting light in which conditions in Victoria Gaol were viewed. Little imagination is needed to conjure up a Piranesian vision of a grim subterranean vault or the fetid unhygienic atmosphere of the cells. The potential suicide’s few desolate lines distill the unbearable torment of illness and despair in captivity. The bleaker quotations alternate with self-congratulatory claims that Victoria Gaol was the best conducted prison in any part of the world. But as this chapter recounts, official rhetoric about orderliness in the prison in Hong Kong, the humane treatment of colonial subjects, and indeed the impartiality of British justice often receded in the onslaught of more and more offenders being taken into custody.\n Diagram showing sight lines from the houses on Chancery Lane down to the Gaol yard.   fullscreen   Diagram showing sight lines from the houses on Chancery Lane down to the Gaol yard.    Who Were the Prisoners?\nThe distinction between European, Indian (or coloured) and Chinese evident in prisoner classification applied equally to Victoria Gaol returns, in which inmates were categorised, at least in the early colonial period, in terms both of these three ethnic markers and of their crimes and offences. Naturally there were annual fluctuations in the figures, the peaks and troughs perhaps corresponding to the growth of population, shifts in social and economic conditions, or changes in sentencing policies, but a pattern does emerge from these records: among Chinese, imprisonment for regulatory offences, non-payment of fines, and property crimes predominated, followed by imprisonment for offences described as ‘misdemeanours’, such as gambling. Those committed for ‘refusal of duty, desertion, etc.’ were all Europeans and Indians, thrown into prison to cool off after breaching military or naval discipline.\nThe return of 1881, a year picked at random, shows 4,150 prisoners passing through the Gaol that year: 295 European males, 1 European female, 53 Indian males, 3,643 Chinese males and 158 Chinese females. Of these, 645 men (European, Indian and Chinese) and women (Chinese) were on remand for trial and pending orders. There was one case of murder (committed by a Chinese male), and three of manslaughter (1 European, 2 Chinese males).51 Other felonies included cutting and wounding, or assault occasioning grievous bodily harm (1 European, 2 Indian and 6 Chinese males; and 3 Chinese females); burglary (26 Chinese males), and robbery with violence (15 Chinese males); child stealing, kidnapping, buying or selling human beings (20 Chinese males, 9 Chinese females); and uttering counterfeit coins or notes (5 Chinese males).\nMost Chinese prisoners were in gaol for relatively minor offences. These fell into three broad categories. One covered acts of larceny—from a house, from a person, from ships or boats in harbour or on the high seas—which accounted for 878 prisoners. More people (901 Chinese males, 10 Chinese females) were committed for gambling, or haunting a gambling house, vagrancy and stowing away on-board ships, aiding and abetting in a misdemeanour, and for being ‘rogues, vagabonds and suspicious characters’. Another 414 Chinese males and 20 Chinese females were convicted of a third class of petty offences, which encompassed unlawful hawking, selling goods without a licence, uttering cries, being without passes or lights, obstruction, nuisance, damaging property, firing crackers, making bonfire, defiling stream, indecent exposure, trespassing, breach of harbour and market regulations, and breach of the opium ordinance.\nNotes   Chinese Repository, Vol. XII, No. 10 (October 1843), 534. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Report on the State and Conditions of the Jails, 12 May 1847, in CO129/27, 135–40. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Friend of China, 17 August 1861. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n China Mail, 25 May 1867. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Frodsham (translated and annotated), The First Chinese Embassy to the West, 10. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Report of the Superintendent of Victoria Gaol, for 1885, Sessional Papers, 1885–86, 149. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Memorial Respecting Gaol Extension, 6 January 1893, Hongkong Government Gazette, 28 January 1893, 57. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Translation of Ai Wu, ‘A Night in Victoria Gaol’; original in Tang Jixiang and Wang Sha (eds.), Ai Wu ji. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":8,"length":1115,"title":"8.

Achieving the balance between the minimum amount of food and the maximum amount of labour was less easy, however, since prisoners seemed often to gain rather than lose weight during their term. It appeared to have occurred to only a few officials that many of them would have come off the streets as ‘weak and broken-down’ men2 who were probably already malnourished, emaciated and in ill-health.\nBut if the effect of penal dietaries proved nebulous, there were other, more measurable physical penalties. These consisted of light chores such as gaol cleaning, ‘scavengering’, cooking, washing, and mat-making. Hard-labour discipline included the crank, shot-drill, oakum-picking with stone-carrying as an alternative, and stone-breaking and dressing. Hard-labour sentences were imposed either by order of the courts, or for breaches of gaol regulations. Prisoners generally worked between six and ten hours a day, typically from 7 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., with an hour off for dinner. They were excused work on Saturday afternoons, which were devoted to ablution, as well as on Sundays.\n At one time the Gaol had a bulding that was constructed specifically to house a tread wheel. The tread wheel or treadmill was a device for imposing hard labour on prisoners.   fullscreen   At one time the Gaol had a bulding that was constructed specifically to house a tread wheel. The tread wheel or treadmill was a device for imposing hard labour on prisoners.    The Crank, the Shot-Drill and Stone-Carrying\nInstead of the tread wheel, MacDonnell proposed introducing the crank and the shot-drill, both of which were ‘irksome and disagreeable work of a strictly penal character’.3 With the 12 cranks he solicited from the Colonial Office, he hoped to frustrate malingerers who injured themselves in order to be excused from working on the roads. Refusal to labour was the most common offence. It seems, though, that most of the cranks did little more than gather dust, because apparently the operating instructions, if they were sent, had soon disappeared and no one quite knew how to work the contraptions. By 1877 only two were still used as an alternative to the shot-drill; another two were unaccounted for; the remaining eight, the Gaol Committee members suggested, should be put back into service at once. The members agreed with MacDonnell that of the hard labour tasks only the crank and the shot-drill could be considered strictly penal.\nG.L. Tomlin, the acting Superintendent, put up a feeble fight against this recommendation. One inevitable consequence of the greater use of cranks, he maintained, was likely to be an increase of air pollution in the Gaol, since the men employed on the cranks would be ‘obliged to use a “bucket” instead of the latrine in the yard in relieving the wants of nature’.4 The Committee dismissed his objection as ‘a fault of administration’ that could be easily overcome. There followed a revival of this punishment, and 50 more cranks were ordered for the Gaol in 1887.5 It was the warders’ responsibility to calibrate the pressure and tighten the crank (this is the origin of their being nicknamed ‘screws’ in Britain). Without this turning up of the weight or pressure, the cranks were completely ineffective. The acting Superintendent Alexander MacDonald Thomson attributed a steep rise in the number of floggings in the Gaol between 1891 and 1895 to a misuse of the cranks:\n About September last year, in the course of my usual inspections, I came to the conclusion that the head turnkey was not doing his duty and that the cranks were not up to the proper strength. I ordered the warder to make a surprise test of all the cranks immediately on receipt of the head turnkey’s certificate. One morning, in doing so, he found that most of the cranks were very much under weight— under test—and a large proportion of them had no weight at all . . . the result of that was that all the cranks being up to the proper test, the prisoners, as I believed, entered into a conspiracy to refuse to do the labour, and the result was a large increase in the number of floggings.6\n Well established in 19th-century England, the crank was considered by penologists to be doubly fitting as a punishment: first, it was installed inside a cell and could therefore be worked by prisoners alone; secondly, if set at the right weight or pressure, the labour it extracted was systematic and measurable. In Hong Kong, for instance, men sentenced to penal labour in 1873 had to complete 14,000 revolutions a day, adjusted to ‘not exceeding 15,300’ turns in 1876, and further to 12,500 at a 12-pound pressure in subsequent years.\nThe punishment might have been measurable in terms of effort but individual experience of the degree of harshness was more difficult to gauge. To Chinese prisoners, the 1877 Gaol Committee observed, oakum-picking was the most laborious and disagreeable, while Europeans were particularly averse to the shot-drill. In 1887 a gaol administrator took a contrary view, remarking that the crank was ‘much disliked by the Chinese to whom it is much more distasteful than shot drill or oakum picking’.6 José Rizal, the Filipino nationalist who visited Victoria Gaol in March 1892, left a vivid account of the crank in operation. The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell, Rizal noted, turning\n a leather-covered crank attached to the wall. This crank is connected to a meter with a plate whose numbers indicate what should be done before each meal. The room is dark. From outside can be seen the moving end of the axis; there is an arrow indicating the direction. Every prisoner has to walk back and forth 12,500 times a day and if he fails to do it, he will be punished. The resistance weight of the crank is probably from 10 to 16 pounds. There is a book there in which are recorded the number of turns one has made and the number of days that he has to work. It is hard work and it is a pity that so much motive power is not employed in something useful.7\n  Under the watchful eye of a warder, prisoners are punished with the shot-drill.   fullscreen   Under the watchful eye of a warder, prisoners are punished with the shot-drill.    The shot-drill was equally unproductive: in fact it was impossible to imagine anything more ingeniously useless, an English social commentator remarked in 1862. But Lord Carnarvon and his 1863 committee on gaol discipline approved of this very uselessness, maintaining that the prisoner’s awareness of the futility of his exertions would add insult to injury and reinforce the punishment. Rizal also observed the shot-drill exercise in action: at a warder’s command, the prisoner had to bend and lift a heavy ‘shot’ or cannonball with both hands, take a few paces, and then put it down. Shots were 18, 24 or 32 pounds in weight. The prisoner then repeated the action—again and again for four hours, in spells of half an hour at a time, with stone-carrying or oakum-picking during the intervals. The stone-carrying was a local version of an endurance test: it involved the prisoner walking around the yard with two large pieces of granite (total load of about 45 pounds) suspended from a bamboo pole placed across the shoulders.\nNotes   Report of the Gaol committee, Hongkong Government Gazette, 10 March 1877, 116. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Colonia Surgeon's Report for 1878, Hongkong Government Gazette, 9 July 1879, 405. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n MacDonnell to Buckingham, 29 May 1868, CO 129/130, 560. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Report of the Gaol Committee, Hongkong Government Gazette, 10 March 1877, 119. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Annual Report of the Superintendent of Victoria Gaol for 1887, Hongkong Government Gazette, 31 March 1888, 338. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Report of the Committee Appointed to Enquire into the Question of Flogging in Victoria Gaol, Sessional Papers, 1896, 60. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Rizal, \u0026lsquo;A Visit to Victoria Gaol\u0026rsquo; (trans.

Prison Policy and Punishments","type":"essay","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/taikwun/9_policy/"},{"content":"The experience of prison varied from person to person depending on his or her background, but unless the prisoners were educated and literate, their stories were unlikely to survive, so although hawkers and beggars were representative of countless others who passed through Victoria Gaol, they were the silent majority. For prisoner narratives we must look to the memoirs of a number of political dissidents and journalists who happened to do time in Hong Kong. Glimpses of individual prisoners who stood out from the masses can also be construed from between the lines of newspaper reports recording the sojourn of people under deportation orders, or drawn from testimonies given at some of the more sensational trials.\nW.H. Adsetts\n‘One of the most cold-blooded ever committed in Hong Kong by a white man’ was how Detective Sergeant Ed O’Sullivan described the murder dubbed ‘The Trunk Tragedy’ by the China Mail in its reports in August and September 1907.1 The murder was committed by William Hall Adsetts, variously described as an American Marine and a plumber and tinsmith, and his victim was a Miss Gertrude Dayton, a prostitute—a member, the Crown Solicitor observed, of the ‘unfortunate class’ in Manila.2\nUnfolding over a month during preliminary hearings in the Magistracy and the full trial in the Supreme Court, the stories that emerged from a multitude of witnesses transfixed the public in Manila, Chefoo (Yantai), Shanghai and Hong Kong. At the beginning of the trial, there was such a rush for seats by sensation-hunters and the merely curious that all Chinese at the back of the court had to be turned out to make room for Europeans and foreigners. Victoria Gaol, where the accused was held during the period from his being remanded to the custody of the police until his execution, basked in the reflected notoriety of this case.\n Artist's rendering of William Adsetts transporting the trunk containing Gerturde Dayton's body to the steamship Monteagle.   fullscreen   Artist's rendering of William Adsetts transporting the trunk containing Gerturde Dayton's body to the steamship Monteagle.    On Saturday 3 August a man and a woman travelling under the name of ‘Mr and Mrs W.H. Jones’ arrived from Manila and checked into the Hongkong Hotel. Among their luggage was a large Saratoga trunk measuring roughly 2 feet 6 inches long, 20 inches wide and about 2 feet deep. They were a handsome couple: he was in his late 20s, of above average height, with light brown hair and blue eyes, and several of his teeth were ‘stopped in gold’,74 a feature that later helped various witnesses to identify him; she was a statuesque blonde, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, with rather angular arms and long white pointed fingers, on which sparkled a number of rings. It later transpired that the woman, having skipped Manila in a hurry with some insurance money that belonged to another, had brought all her jewellery with her.\nAfter dining together, Adsetts and Dayton proceeded to spend the evening with Dayton’s old friends in two ‘gay houses’3 at 52 Hollywood Road and 18 Hollywood Road, where they drank a great deal of champagne and wine. They left the second brothel between two and three o’clock in the morning. Nobody at the hotel saw them return. Adsetts later maintained that he had been separated from Dayton, and though too drunk to remember much he did recall spending the rest of the night with another prostitute in an unknown Japanese brothel in Ship Street in Wan Chai. He returned to the Hongkong Hotel early the next morning to discover that Dayton was not sleeping off her night of heavy drinking but dead. He claimed that his actions afterwards were prompted by panic. Events then took on a surreal quality.\nAdsetts came out of his room at around eight o’clock and ordered two coolies to move his Saratoga trunk downstairs. In the hotel lobby he engaged another two coolies to help him carry the trunk to the office of Butterfield and Swire. He told the shipping clerk there that he wanted to consign the trunk to a Mr A.H. Jacques in Hoihow (Haikou) in China. No address was given for Jacques, but Adsetts said Jacques would call for it when the trunk reached its destination. Later, Adsetts returned to the shipping office and removed the trunk. He engaged two more coolies to take him and the trunk to Murray Pier, where he found a sampan woman, who understood a little English, to ply him and the trunk across the water to a steamship, the Monteagle, then lying in Causeway Bay. She recounted the transaction in court: ‘I wanchee sampan one hour,’ the ‘European’ had said to her. ‘I talkee him eighty cents. He talkee my all right two dollar!’4\nOn board the Monteagle Adsetts persuaded its quartermaster to take the trunk into the ship’s baggage room, promising to return later. And there the trunk lay until the 7th, when a stench that was beginning to permeate the ship was traced to its source. Forced open, the trunk was found to contain the decomposed body of an adult female, apparently strangled. The body was lying on its side and jammed into the trunk; the knees were doubled up under the chin, and the head was more or less concealed by the arms. Around her neck was a waist band from her dress, twisted tightly with a hairbrush that had obviously served as a tourniquet. Two towels marked ‘Hongkong Hotel’ were found in the trunk—a vital clue that helped the police trace the murder to Adsetts.\nA witness from one of the brothels in Hollywood Road later identified the dead woman as Gertrude Dayton by the gold crowns on her teeth, the contours of her arms and her long pointed fingers. By then Adsetts, after pawning two diamonds at a shop in Queen’s Road, had left town for Shanghai (the pawnbroker recognised him by his gold teeth in an identification parade later held in Victoria Gaol). Then, keeping one step ahead of the police, he slipped away to Chefoo in northern China. He had all Dayton’s jewellery with him, and she had a considerable amount, not to mention fourteen post office orders of $100 gold each. From Chefoo he escaped to Manila, and it was there that the law—in the shape of Detective Sergeant Ed O’Sullivan and Detective Perkins of the police force in Hong Kong—finally caught up with him. Extradited from Manila to stand trial in Hong Kong, Adsetts was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was hanged on 13 November 1907.\nAi Wu\nIn the early 20th century Hong Kong was the transhipment point for overseas Chinese deported to China from British, French and Dutch colonies in Asia and from places as far afield as Britain, Mauritius and the United States. Among them were vagrants, superannuated labourers, and banished political dissidents. The Hong Kong Police handled these deportees, along with the thousands deported from within Hong Kong. Many spent a night or two in Victoria Gaol.\n Ai Wu in Shanghai, 1931.   fullscreen   Ai Wu in Shanghai, 1931.    In 1931 more than 80 political deportees from Rangoon were transferred through Hong Kong. One of them was the Chinese writer, Ai Wu (1904–1992). Born Tang Daogeng in Sichuan, he left home in 1925 and led the life of a drifter for several years, taking odd jobs to fund his travels. He walked from Chengdu to Kunming, and crossed from Yunnan into British Burma, where he eventually found work as assistant editor on a newspaper. He had mingled with people living on the edge of destitution during his life on the road. Now, galvanised by what he described as the ‘English imperialists’ shady schemes of deception and oppression’ over the poor and weak, he voiced his support of a Burmese peasants’ revolt. For this he was packed off on a ship for deportation back to China via Hong Kong.\nHe had long wanted to see Hong Kong, in his mind’s eye a glittering city he likened to an ingénue garlanded with pearls and jade. As his ship sailed into the harbour in the winter of 1931, the sight of a mountain ablaze with lights seemed to promise all he had dreamed. Instead he and other deportees were taken to the police station and clapped into Victoria Gaol—the process was as simple, he noted, as driving swine into a pigsty. He wrote a graphic account of his one night in this ‘free government hotel’ two years later:\n huddled in a cell measuring not much more than 12 square metres. They woke, startled, their eyes peering at us from faces bloated with dropsy . . . A tinplate chamber pot stood in one corner; it had obviously overflowed, because the floor around it was awash with urine. A couple of banana-shaped lumps of shit lay nearby. The whole cell was pervaded by the acrid stench of disinfectant and ordure—the degradation of it struck us as something from another world . . . On the other side of the grating, like some flickering shadow of a ghost, a black-coated Indian guard, rifle on shoulder, paced to and fro. The scene was the stuff of anger, and our rage exploded in a torrent of abuse: ‘Foreign devils! Damn you! Red-haired barbarians!’ Conditions in the Burmese detention centre were so much better than this place: a meal on arrival, a blanket at bedtime, a spacious cell, enough air to breathe, and even a Western-style flush lavatory . . . Here in Hong Kong, who cares if you are hungry or cold or asphyxiated by the stink of the chamber pot? We couldn’t help screaming: ‘Red-haired barbarians! You treat us worse than slaves!’ Later we fell into conversation with the other six prisoners. None of them had done anything wrong except lose their jobs in Singapore, their place of sojourn. How outrageous! Is it a crime to be unemployed? . . . If they are to be deported, by all means send them back, but why should they have to suffer even a moment in this pigsty? Are the laws of this so-called civilised country so unjust? These labourers’ blood and sweat built the prosperity of Malaya and the Straits Settlements for those ungrateful imperialist pigs and dogs to enjoy. Then they are bundled off into banishment . . .89 It is said that the measure of a civilisation is its prisons and how prisoners are treated. Ai Wu implicitly concurred, portraying the grim reality of Victoria Gaol as a mirror image of the racism and brutalities of imperialism. His account remains a rare first-hand testimony in Chinese of being inside Victoria Gaol. The next day on a ship bound for Amoy, he confessed to a sense of sadness tinged with anger. ‘My deepest impression of Hong Kong,’ he observed, ‘is the viciousness of imperialism and the filth and stink of the chamber pot!’\n Notes   China Mail, 23 September 1907. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hongkong Daily Press, 2 October 1907. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hongkong Telegraph, 23 October 1907. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hongkong Telegraph, 7 October 1907. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":10,"length":1845,"title":"10.
