The starting point of the site’s architecture and development is the establishment of the colony of Hong Kong in 1841, and the construction of its very first buildings. The engineer John Ouchterlony wrote about the incredible speed with which the new island settlement was built:

>With such extraordinary celerity were these building operations carried on, that, in due course of two months, the native town, Victoria, which had before presented to the eye scarcely anything but streets and rows of houses, formed of the most crazy, perishable, and inflammable materials, now boasted at least a hundred brick tenements, besides a spacious and commodious market place.’[^1]

Captain Arthur Cunynghame, a soldier with the British expeditionary force to China in the early 1840s, was similarly impressed:

>Perhaps no place in the history of ages can boast of such a rapid rise as the town of Hong Kong. In August, 1841, not one single house was yet built, not a portion of the brush-wood had been cleared away from this desolate spot. By June, 1842, the town was considerably more than two miles long, containing store-houses and shops, here called ‘Go-downs’, in which almost every article either Eastern or European could be procured, and most of them, at not very unreasonable prices.[^2]

This level of building could not have taken place, as Governor Sir John Davis recognised in 1846, ‘except for the ready command of the cheap and efficient labor of the Chinese’.[^3] Since there was initially not much in the way of guidance or government control, the design and construction of the buildings was often of poor quality. Chinese contractors were unfamiliar with the Western style of building and its economics, and many of them defaulted or went bankrupt, having given unrealistic quotations: ‘almost all contracts hitherto entered into with Chinamen have been obliged to be finished by Government, for the works were taken at far too low an estimate, and the consequence was, when the parties found they would become losers, both contractor and security decamped, and in some instances were imprisoned.’[^3] Nevertheless, great numbers of Chinese contractors persisted in the work, as an American visitor, Osmond Tiffany, observed in 1849: buildings were ‘run up and finished with magic ease; one day the cellar would be dug, and the next the roof was being finished’.[^4]

In contrast to the brick tenements, the earliest buildings on the Central Police Station site, dating from the 1840s and 1850s, were constructed largely of locally sourced stone (in this case granite) and timber, materials that would have been familiar in contemporary British architecture. Found in abundance in Hong Kong, granite is a tough and durable material, particularly suited to large public and commercial buildings. Built in an adapted British architectural style, these buildings introduced a feeling of permanence to the colonial presence in Hong Kong.

**Construction of Barrack Block and Headquarters Block**

A design for the Central Police Station was soon prepared. Signed off by the Surveyor General Charles Cleverly in 1862, the plan proposed a suite of buildings that would provide all of the necessary facilities for a working police force, including living quarters, offices, stables and holding cells. One main structure nevertheless dominated all of the rest: at first referred to simply as the ‘Central Police Station’, this later became known as ‘Barrack Block’.

Covering three floors, Barrack Block extended from east to west across the centre of the site and was completed in 1864. In contrast to the plain, somewhat monolithic gaol buildings, this was a relatively grand affair, developed on the same principles as a British military barracks. Its neo-classical north façade, featuring a chamfered projecting portico with a pediment at its centre, overlooked a parade ground. This was mirrored in projecting bays at either end. The façade was
pierced by large, exposed granite archways on the ground floor, and by verandas on the first and second floors.

Architectural detailing made the verandas distinctive: this included arched openings and turned stone balusters on the first floor and rectangular openings with pilasters between, with flat stone baluster screens and timber sun screens on the second floor. Characteristic of colonial design and seen on other contemporary public buildings, these elements were all part of an architectural language that not only linked the buildings by a common aesthetic but also created a feeling of authority.

Barrack Block provided billeting for 202 single constables, accommodating them in long dormitory rooms running either side of the central chamfered bay, with windows to the south and verandas to the north. The usual convention of placing verandas on the south to provide shelter from the sun was thus reversed, presumably because it would have exposed the occupants to a view of the Gaol. Cast-iron ventilation grilles in the high ceilings as well as fireplaces, which had surrounds with roundels, would have added to the occupants’ comfort in summer and winter. Timber-screen partitioning provided some division within the largest rooms, which each held a total of 32 beds. All these features, along with timber shutters to the French windows and ‘day rooms’ for relaxation, contributed a touch of domesticity. The higher-ranking sergeants had rooms in the projecting end bays on the east and west. Up to five single sergeants and the same number of married sergeants could be housed: rooms for the latter were an extra four or five feet in width to accommodate their families.


**Headquarters Block**

Despite the new floor, the additional space was not enough, and in 1911, as a temporary measure, matsheds were erected in the parade ground north of Barrack Block. In 1913 the Governor of Hong Kong asked the Secretary of State to approve the erection of quarters for 94 Chinese and 50 Indian police, a store, an officers’ mess room, a gymnasium, and reading and rest rooms. A year later a plot of land immediately north of the existing police station site and facing Hollywood Road was resumed by the government at a cost of approximately $244,360. It already consisted of 18 terraced buildings, so the first task of the contractor, Messrs. Sang & Lee Co., was to demolish the buildings. By the end of 1916, these were gone and the foundations for the new building were completed. In the following year Messrs. Kien On & Co. began building a superstructure. The steelwork floor girders and roof trusses were imported from Lanarkshire Steel in Scotland; the project was practically at a standstill for nine months as the steel did not arrive until late in 1917. After the first consignment arrived, the erection of stanchions and girders was immediately resumed. Headquarters Block was finally completed in 1919 at a cost of $227,633.
