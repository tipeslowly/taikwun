Architecturally, the Central Police Station, Central Magistracy and Victoria Gaol are a legacy of the British Empire. Despite adaptations to local conditions and climate, such as Chinese roof-tiles and verandas added for shade from the blistering subtropical sun, the primary architectural elements are redolent of an imperial connection—Roman doric columns, arches and pediments engraved with ‘G’ and ‘R’ on the Headquarters Block. The apparently impregnable surrounding walls, and the buildings’ intimidating massiveness, suggest something immaterial as well: this was a bastion of colonial power, a beacon flashing the unmistakable message of security, law and punishment.

Generations of men and women were caught up in the criminal justice system. More than a million and a half predominantly Chinese went through the Central Magistracy between 1841 and 1941: thieves and murderers, kidnappers and rapists, hawkers and street boys, vagrants and drunken sailors, prostitutes and gamblers, debtors and beggars, the guilty as well as the innocent. Their lives were commemorated only when, running afoul of the law, their misdeeds were reported in the newspapers. But such memorials are no less meaningful than the monuments in stone. If buildings take precedence over people, the historian Roy Porter observed, we get heritage, not history.[^1]

For decades, the public's gaze had been averted from a spot that struck onlookers as forbidding, secretive and full of misery. The forlorn wails of Gaol inmates occasionally erupting—so loud that the entire neighbourhood could hear—left no doubt that this was where suffering came to linger. Screams from those subjected to corporal punishment mingled with the ‘terrible cries’ of the lunatics, ‘who kept the whole Hospital or Gaol in an uproar’.[^2] Equally provocative of the dismay, revulsion or prurient fascination were the public executions that took place, first in the Magistracy compound, and from 1879 in a yard of the Gaol. Public hangings were not abolished until 1895.

Pervasive in the criminal justice system in early colonial Hong Kong, racial discrimination was not so much a policy of colonial oppression as the outcome of distrust, prejudice, misunderstanding, impatience and fear, though in times of emergency it often seemed both deliberate and excessively severe. In the normal course of events, the magistrates, warders and policemen who lived and worked in these buildings would have no monuments to their memory. They were ordinary people, not personages whose names and deeds are generally perpetuated by portraits and statues. Yet they did receive a monument—in these evocative examples of Anglo-Chinese architecture that were listed for statutory protection by the Hong Kong government in 1995.
