**1841–1941**

During the 101 years from the British occupation of Hong Kong in January 1841 to the Japanese invasion in December 1941, magistrates sitting in the Magistracy on Arbuthnot Road heard over a million cases, in which more than a million-and-a-half defendants appeared, along with a similar number of witnesses. Many of these cases were crimes in the usual sense of the word. Thefts, burglaries and assaults of various descriptions were the most common. A much smaller number of robbery, piracy, rape and murder cases went up to the Supreme Court for trial by jury, often after committal proceedings in the Magistracy lasting several days or weeks. The majority of cases, however, were of a non-criminal nature involving offences introduced, for example, to promote cleanliness, order and decency in public places, or to protect government revenue derived from licences and monopolies.

**1928: Misconduct as a Police Officer—The Advent of the Motor Car**


>Before Major C. Willson at the Central Magistracy yesterday morning P.C.
Khushi Mahomed was ordered to pay the sum of $50 to the owner of the car,
which as a result of his meddling took a backward plunge into the Harbour on
Sunday night. As previously narrated P.C. Khushi Mahomed came across an
Overland Whippet parked outside the Canton Wharf on Sunday night and as
the driver had left it he took the opportunity to further his mechanical knowledge
and tampered with the gears. Unfortunately, his foot must have come in contact
with the electric starter and as the car had been left in the gear, the machine took a
backward plunge into the Harbour.

In addition to the $50 in compensation to the owner, the hapless P.C. Mahomed was also fined $50 for misconduct as a police officer, making a total of $100, equal to about four months’ pay for an Indian police constable.[^1] Unpleasant though the episode may have been for P.C. Mahomed, who had himself been dragged into the harbour as the car went over the seawall, the incident resulted in no lasting injuries. The punishment was a moderate one, thanks largely to the intervention of the senior police officer P.P.J. Wodehouse on Mahomed’s behalf. The police also arranged for the Overland Whippet, an American make, to be raised from the harbour. The damage, estimated at $300, was covered by insurance. Other victims of motor-car accidents that year were less fortunate. In 1928, when Hong Kong’s roads had only 2,177 licensed motor vehicles, there were 888 motor accidents, of which 39 were fatal. By the 1930s minor traffic offences were accounting for about one fifth of all magistracy cases. Most involved speeding, illegal parking, obstruction, and driving without a valid licence.

By 1938 the number of motor vehicles had doubled and the annual number of fatalities from road accidents had increased threefold, to 119 (two more than the 117 fatal traffic accidents recorded in 2015, when the number of licensed motor vehicles was over 100 times that in 1938). Motorists blamed poor lighting, lack of footpaths, obstructive verandas, and ‘ignorant pedestrians’ who were used to walking in the middle of the road. Occasionally drivers were prosecuted for reckless driving or manslaughter. The introduction of the motor car in Hong Kong in about 190544 had not been popular.

Under regulations introduced in 1911, practically all of the streets of the City of Victoria were off limits to cars. The prohibited area was bounded by Queen’s Road to the north and Caine and Bonham Roads to the south, from Garden Road in the east to Pok Fu Lam Road in the west. A route along part of Hollywood Road, Lyndhurst Terrace, Wellington Street, and D’Aguilar Street down to Queen’s Road was demarcated for motor cars provided that they travelled at a speed of no more than 7 miles an hour. Cars were banned on the Peak and along Kennedy and Bowen Roads, and were restricted to speed limits of 10 miles per hour on the main roads in Victoria and up to a maximum of 20 miles per hour in other parts of the colony, including the New Territories.

In 1912 several prominent Chinese residents prepared a ‘monster petition’ calling for a complete ban on motor cars.
The petition, rumoured to have attracted 10,000 names, was prompted by an incident in which a court interpreter, Wong
Kwong Tin, was nearly knocked over by a car that had swerved from Des Voeux Road onto Wing Lok Street. The driver was fined $5 for furious driving. Instead of a ban, the government tightened traffic regulations, requiring cars to have horns and prohibiting them from being driven between midnight and 6 a.m., except for medical emergencies [. . .]

**1933: Hawking Newspapers without a Licence—Street Children**


>Many Newsboys Cautioned
Is this going to be a weekly habit of yours?’ said Mr Wynne-Jones at Central
Magistracy yesterday when 2 girls and 18 boys, whose ages ranged from 6 to 16,
were brought before him on a charge of hawking newspapers without a licence.
‘Mo faan sik’ (‘No rice to eat’) was the general reply.
Sub-Inspector Carey, who prosecuted told His Worship that Chinese
youngsters preferred hawking newspapers in the Colony because there were more
Chinese papers here than in Canton. ‘The Hong Kong small newspapers,’ he said, can say what they like about Canton officials and the officials of China, while in
Canton they regard it as hazardous.’
Most of the offenders were cautioned while several others were fined $1 or
two strokes with the cane. One lad was given two strokes, but his motor bus fare is
to be paid to Au Tau, his native village.
Hongkong Daily Press, 18 March 1933


Those boys and girls were among the hundreds of child hawkers and shoeblacks who made a precarious living in the streets and lanes of Central. They were familiar figures in E.I. Wynne-Jones’s court, and towards most he showed a paternal interest, albeit a stern one. The shoeblacks were partly the government’s creation. Some years earlier the Street Boys’ Club, organised by the police and housed for a while in the new Magistracy building, had enlisted the help of a number of firms selling shoe polish, which had fitted several boys out with equipment and smart red uniforms bearing the badges of the ‘Nugget’ or ‘Cherry Blossom’ brands, after the practice in London. But the numbers had got out of control and some of the boys had taken to mobbing their prospective clients. ‘They practically pull you to pieces,’ observed Wynne-Jones, though he acknowledged they were doing useful work. At times, however, his patience wore thin. In April, when dealing with a batch of 21 juvenile newspapers hawkers, he remarked that the best solution would be for him and
Inspector Carey to go down to the streets, armed with a cane, ‘and thrash these lads on the spot’. Wynne-Jones sentenced those over 14 to a fine of $1 or two strokes of the cane. He then waved a cane in his hand to the others, saying, ‘I have a big Sergeant here, and I am going to let him loose on you the next time.’[^2]

Some of the street children were orphans. Others had run away from home in the country—in the case of one of Wynne-Jones’s boys because his father had caned him too much. Others lived with their families or relatives in cubicle or bedspace accommodation in the crowded tenements in the Western District. The churches, charitable organisations and Tung Wah Hospital offered some relief, as did the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children, which was formally inaugurated in January 1930. Every business day, between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. Chinese shops and businesses along Queen’s Road handed out leftover food after their staff had finished their evening meals. On Queen Victoria Street a line of women sold half-rotten bits of vegetables discarded from the Central Market nearby to others who were hardly
less poor than they.

The traditional attitude of the government was that the poor were not Hong Kong’s responsibility. To provide even the minimum of assistance, it feared, would risk drawing thousands of prospective recipients from the poverty-stricken neighbouring provinces. Instead, the government either outsourced the problem through regular expulsions of beggars, or resorted to the law. Some 276 persons were brought before the Hong Kong Island magistrates for begging in 1933. Another 619 mendicants were fingerprinted and summarily deported by the police. A much larger number of people—over 6,000—were convicted of various hawking offences. Magistrates were generally sympathetic, letting many off with cautions and assisting some of the more distressing cases out of the poor box (which was replenished from time to time with the proceeds of gambling raids). Hawking vegetables and especially newspapers, they observed in their reports later in the decade, was ‘the mainstay of the child breadwinner’.[^3]
