Remarking on the state of crime in 1877, the Chief Justice Sir John Smale observed that Hong Kong’s police force was thicker on the ground than anywhere else in the British Empire. He attributed this to the fact that the colony received some of ‘the worst and most dangerous characters’ from its mainland neighbour, China. Six years earlier the ratio of police strength was reported to be 1 to 255 of the population, far higher than for cities such as Liverpool and Manchester.

Hong Kong remains one of the most heavily policed cities in the world. According to official figures, it had one police officer for every 256 of the population in 2016, comparable to the ratio for London and more than New York. Today the force operates from its headquarters in Wan Chai and six regional centres covering Hong Kong Island, Kowloon East, Kowloon West, New Territories North, New Territories South and ‘Marine’. For nearly a century its base was the Central Police Station on Hollywood Road, at the heart of the ‘European portion of the city’,[^1] according to Walter Meredith Deane, Captain Superintendent of Police in 1867–1892. From this station, its officers fanned out to keep the peace, maintain public order and cleanliness, extinguish fires, regulate traffic, apprehend illegal immigrants, counter terrorism, and, above all, prevent and detect crime. It was in the crime-fighting arena that the police in the early colony engaged most frequently with the ordinary people around them.

The history of the colonial police force is inextricably bound up with the Central Police Station. Nearly all the cases of police action began with constables and officers quartered in the Central Police Station, and ended with offenders or suspects being taken there. Our account begins with the appointment of Captain William Caine as Chief Magistrate in 1841, before the Central Police Station was established. Caine was ‘military and oriental’ in his style of enforcing the law on a population that he considered depraved and hostile. He punished lawbreakers by flogging, an expedient he claimed to have borrowed from the Qing legal code, and to prevent crime he would impose a curfew.

The approach of his successor, Charles May, if somewhat different, was also in part based on the concept of preventive policing. There was no shortage of ordinary people coming forward to report incidents of robbery, theft, assault and other crimes, but since the colonial police force initially lacked the skills for detecting crime, it fell back on preventing the commission of crime. This raises another theme: the deployment of the police force as an organ of social control. On the lookout for unsocial behaviour and public indecency, in case these might escalate into graver criminal acts, policemen were given authority to clear the streets and tenements of minor nuisances, sly brothels and unlicensed gambling dens.

Hong Kong also adopted the policy characterised as policing by ‘strangers’, a strategy found in several parts of the British Empire. From 1854 to the end of World War II, over half of the police force were recruited from outside of Hong Kong, mainly from Britain for officers and India for sergeants and constables. This inevitably created tension among the rank and file, a mutually uncomprehending group of men of diverse ethnic origins with nothing in common, least of all a shared language. To illustrate their problematic relationships, this chapter includes the stories of a number of European, Indian and Chinese constables as they went about their duties. Through the 19th century, their attempts to cope with consistently high crime rates and to control the more numerous and frequently migratory Chinese were woefully ineffective.

**A Pretty Motley Group of Roughs**

[As well as May’s ‘Hindus’,] men of every colour and stripe were to be found in the colonial police force. May called them ‘an incongruous mass’, as he listed the ethnic composition of his force:

1st—White natives of Europe or America.<br>
2nd—Christian natives of Goa, Macao, and other Spanish and Portuguese
settlements.<br>
3rd—Natives of India, mostly Mahommedan or Hindu, intermixed with
coloured men from British North America, the West Indian Colonies, and the United
States, Maltese, Arabs, and Malays.[^2]<br>

Stereotypes of the main ethnic groups were portrayed in a few ‘pungent lines’ by a Mr Small in the Hongkong Daily Press in 1871:

>They’ve given you here as ‘Guardians of the peace,’<br>
An inefficient staff of mix’d police,<br>
A pretty motley group of roughs, I swear,<br>
A riff-raff, pick’d up heav’n alone knows where.<br>
Drunken Europeans and the lanky Sikh,<br>
Who cannot understand a word we speak;<br>
Lazy Indians, too, from various tribes,<br>
Chinese detectives who are fond of bribes—<br>
In league—if all I hear be true—<br>
With gamblers, thieves, and even murderers too.<br>
Shame on the Government, a shame I say,<br>
To keep such barefac’d robbers in their pay.[^3]

Figures showing the ethnic composition and strength of the colonial police force plucked randomly from annual reports through the late 19th and early 20th centuries disclose a policy of never allowing the local Chinese to outnumber Europeans and other ‘foreigners’. The ‘foreigners’ were usually Indians and, for a time, West Indians from Jamaica, but also would later include Northern Chinese. In 1922, a couple of years after China began negotiations for the retrocession of leased territories, and Britain prepared to withdraw from Weihaiwei in Shandong province, Governor Stubbs proposed the idea of taking on the Europeans and Chinese serving in the police. Thomas Henry King, Assistant Superintendent of Police, was duly sent to recruit 50 officers from Shandong. The first Weihaiwei contingent arrived in March 1923. They were posted to stations in the New Territories, relieving the Indians who had manned the posts.

Further batches of men arrived over the next nine months to boost manpower in stations in Kowloon as well as the New Territories. From 1926, increasing numbers of these northerners would form a strong contingent within the Hong Kong police force. If they were not assigned to the Emergency Unit, the Weihaiwei men were detailed to work alongside the 30 or so White Russians who formed the backbone of the Anti-Piracy Guard in the 1930s. Not only were these northerners taller (they had to be at least 5 feet 7 inches) and more rugged than the Cantonese southerners, they also spoke a different dialect and had no sense of unity with the Cantonese. They were, to all intents and purposes, as alien as any from another country. Recruitment ceased in the mid-1940s and natural wastage depleted their ranks in the 1960s. The colony’s heavy police presence was costly yet ineffective. Paying for so inept a force, the colonists grumbled, was throwing good money after bad. Much of the agonising revolved round prejudices about the attributes of men of different races and cultures, along with the question of how they would perform when put on their mettle.

The question was never really settled, but three arguments emerge with wearying consistency: the top command should always be English, Scottish or Irish (or ‘European’, in the nomenclature of the early colonists); for lowlier officers and the rank and file, Indians were preferred, especially since they could be fairly easily, if expensively, deployed from British India; as for the ‘natives’, their reliability was suspect. The question was: who would Chinese policemen support in the event of a clash between their compatriots and representatives of the British Crown? In the seamen’s strike of 1922, for instance, the Chinese constables and detectives apparently fraternised with the strikers; if they had done their duty, it was said, the intimidators would have been rapidly rounded up and the trouble ended in a very short time. Caught in the middle, their loyalties possibly divided, the Chinese posed too much of a risk, and could not be trusted. The historian Philip Snow says, ‘In using Indians to hold the line in Hong Kong the British were applying in all of its simple elegance their classic principle of “divide and rule”.[^4]

Enlisting an ethnically mixed force ‘from all quarters of the world’, Captain Superintendent Deane observed, ‘throws great obstacles in the way of efficiently employing the Force. So many prejudices of color, caste, and nationality have to be overcome . . . and so many petty internal jealousies are nurtured, that all spirit of mutual co-operation for the good of the Public is lost.’[^5] Not least of the obstacles was the lack of a common language between European officers and their Indian subordinates; among the constables, whether Indian or Chinese; and crucially between the policemen and the public they were supposed to protect. The police establishment always included interpreters, and more formal attempts were made from 1869 to address the language problem, starting with the establishment of a Police School.

But in the experience of Deane, a former cadet who spoke Chinese, a shortage of competent linguists continued to hobble the effectiveness of the force. Francis Henry May, Captain Superintendent from 1893 to 1901, admitted that at the height of the bubonic plague epidemic in 1894, the efficiency with which house-to-house visitations were accomplished owed much to the European police who could speak Chinese, and the Chinese police who could speak English. But though

>the demand for Chinese-speaking European Police was very great, I regret to
say that the supply was not equal to the demand. Chinese is such an unattractive
language that it is extremely difficult to induce men to take up the study of it. I
have hesitated to recommend that it be made compulsory lest such a condition
superadded to the low sterling value of the pay should make recruiting at home
more difficult . . .[^6]

Henry May had learned Mandarin in Peking—of little use in Hong Kong at the time—but he took it upon himself to prepare a new First Reading Book to teach English to Indian and Chinese constables. Introduced to the Police School in 1900, the reading book, with translations of the lessons in Chinese and Urdu, ‘at once took the fancy of those men who were able to read their own language’, reported the master in charge of the school. Since it was concerned principally with subjects related to police duties, ‘the book serves a most useful purpose and is of great assistance both to teachers and men’.[^7] Another incentive that expected to yield good results was the introduction of a scheme whereby Indians and Chinese would be granted an allowance for passing an examination in English. And for the Europeans, daily Chinese classes were instituted at all the stations.
