**Conditions in the Gaol**

In 1841 the Gaol in Hong Kong was described as clean and ‘well ventilated’.[^1] Some of its cells were nevertheless ‘destitute of conveniences’ and had ‘neither privies nor water’, according to a report in 1847. A wooden tub provided in each cell for prisoners’ use at night emitted ‘a very offensive smell’ while the floor where it stood was ‘saturated with urine’.[^2]

By 1861 the Gaol had deteriorated into ‘a den in which men were dealt with as beasts’.[^3] A new radial-plan gaol was then constructed, opening to great acclaim in 1866: the *China Mail* thought it ‘the finest prison establishment on this side of India, possibly of the Cape’; indeed, it might be safely said that ‘our prison is one of the most complete and best conducted that exists in any part of the world’.[^4] Guo Songtao, the Chinese envoy, remarked after a visit in 1876 that the Gaol was so clean ‘one forgot that this was a prison’.[^5] Nine years on, a gaol superintendent—denied the facilities to hold prisoners in separate cells—was provoked into saying: ‘Victoria Gaol is unsuited to the demands of modern civilization, or even humanity . . . it seems hardly humane to continue a Prison system in which the enforced association of criminals is well known as tending the make the better class bad and the bad worse.’[^6]

In 1893 leading members of the Chinese community took issue with plans to improve prison conditions, for the Gaol was so comfortable, they said, that it was already ‘looked upon as a paradise by many a rascal’.[^7] The writer Ai Wu, deported from Burma back to China via Hong Kong in 1931, spent a night in Victoria Gaol; in an essay he wrote afterwards, he recalled the acrid stench of ordure and disinfectant in his cell.[^8] For one inmate in 1972, incarceration was comparable to being tortured in hell. ‘It is beyond my capability to endure,’ he wrote, ‘I had better take my own life.’[^9]

These quotations resonate with a whole range of images and meanings that are not only forcefully suggestive of the terrible ordeal of confinement, but also the shifting light in which conditions in Victoria Gaol were viewed. Little imagination is needed to conjure up a Piranesian[^10] vision of a grim subterranean vault or the fetid unhygienic atmosphere of the cells. The potential suicide’s few desolate lines distil the unbearable torment of illness and despair in captivity. The bleaker quotations alternate with self-congratulatory claims that Victoria Gaol was the best conducted prison in any part of the world. But as this chapter recounts, official rhetoric about orderliness in the prison in Hong Kong, the humane treatment of colonial subjects, and indeed the impartiality of British justice often receded in the onslaught of more and more offenders being taken into custody.

**Who Were the Prisoners?**

The distinction between European, Indian (or coloured) and Chinese evident in prisoner classification applied equally to Victoria Gaol returns, in which inmates were categorised, at least in the early colonial period, in terms both of these three ethnic markers and of their crimes and offences. Naturally there were annual fluctuations in the figures, the peaks and troughs perhaps corresponding to the growth of population, shifts in social and economic conditions, or changes in sentencing policies, but a pattern does emerge from these records: among Chinese, imprisonment for regulatory
offences, non-payment of fines, and property crimes predominated, followed by imprisonment for offences described as ‘misdemeanours’, such as gambling. Those committed for ‘refusal of duty, desertion, etc.’ were all Europeans and Indians, thrown into prison to cool off after breaching military or naval discipline.

The return of 1881, a year picked at random, shows 4,150 prisoners passing through the Gaol that year: 295 European males, 1 European female, 53 Indian males, 3,643 Chinese males and 158 Chinese females. Of these, 645 men (European,
Indian and Chinese) and women (Chinese) were on remand for trial and pending orders. There was one case of murder (committed by a Chinese male), and three of manslaughter (1 European, 2 Chinese males).51 Other felonies included cutting and wounding, or assault occasioning grievous bodily harm (1 European, 2 Indian and 6 Chinese males; and 3 Chinese females); burglary (26 Chinese males), and robbery with violence (15 Chinese males); child stealing, kidnapping, buying or selling human beings (20 Chinese males, 9 Chinese females); and uttering counterfeit coins or notes (5 Chinese males).

Most Chinese prisoners were in gaol for relatively minor offences. These fell into three broad categories. One covered acts of larceny—from a house, from a person, from ships or boats in harbour or on the high seas—which accounted for 878 prisoners. More people (901 Chinese males, 10 Chinese females) were committed for gambling, or haunting a gambling house, vagrancy and stowing away on-board ships, aiding and abetting in a misdemeanour, and for being ‘rogues, vagabonds and suspicious characters’. Another 414 Chinese males and 20 Chinese females were convicted of a third class of petty offences, which encompassed unlawful hawking, selling goods without a licence, uttering cries, being without passes or lights, obstruction, nuisance, damaging property, firing crackers, making bonfire, defiling stream, indecent exposure, trespassing, breach of harbour and market regulations, and breach of the opium ordinance.
