**Hard Labour**

Members of the Gaol Committee of 1877 were emphatic that the life of prisoners, and of Chinese prisoners especially, should be made ‘as distasteful as it can possibly be made, consistently with reason and humanity, by hard labour, hard fare, and strict physical discipline’.[^1] ‘Hard fare’ had a double purpose, both carrot and stick, its award transmuted into an incentive for good behaviour, its withholding or reduction inflicted as a punishment. Achieving the balance between the minimum amount of food and the maximum amount of labour was less easy, however, since prisoners seemed often to gain rather than lose weight during their term. It appeared to have occurred to only a few officials that many of them would have come off the streets as ‘weak and brokendown’ men[^2] who were probably already malnourished, emaciated and in ill-health.

But if the effect of penal dietaries proved nebulous, there were other, more measurable physical penalties. These consisted of light chores such as gaol cleaning, ‘scavengering’, cooking, washing, and mat-making. Hard-labour discipline included the crank, shot-drill, oakum-picking with stone-carrying as an alternative, and stone-breaking and dressing. Hard-labour sentences were imposed either by order of the courts, or for breaches of gaol regulations. Prisoners generally worked between six and ten hours a day, typically from 7 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., with an hour off for dinner. They were excused work on Saturday afternoons, which were devoted to ablution, as well as on Sundays.

**The Crank, the Shot-Drill and Stone-Carrying**

Instead of the tread wheel, MacDonnell proposed introducing the crank and the shot-drill, both of which were ‘irksome and disagreeable work of a strictly penal character’.[^3] With the 12 cranks he solicited from the Colonial Office, he hoped to frustrate malingerers who injured themselves in order to be excused from working on the roads. Refusal to labour was the most common offence. It seems, though, that most of the cranks did little more than gather dust, because apparently the operating instructions, if they were sent, had soon disappeared and no one quite knew how to work the
contraptions. By 1877 only two were still used as an alternative to the shot-drill; another two were unaccounted for; the remaining eight, the Gaol Committee members suggested, should be put back into service at once. The members agreed with MacDonnell that of the hard labour tasks only the crank and the shot-drill could be considered strictly penal.

G.L. Tomlin, the acting Superintendent, put up a feeble fight against this recommendation. One inevitable consequence of the greater use of cranks, he maintained, was likely to be an increase of air pollution in the Gaol, since the men employed on the cranks would be ‘obliged to use a “bucket” instead of the latrine in the yard in relieving the wants of nature’.[^4] The Committee dismissed his objection as ‘a fault of administration’ that could be easily overcome. There followed a revival of this punishment, and 50 more cranks were ordered for the Gaol in 1887.[^5] It was the warders’ responsibility to calibrate the pressure and tighten the crank (this is the origin of their being nicknamed ‘screws’ in Britain). Without this turning up of the weight or pressure, the cranks were completely ineffective. The acting
Superintendent Alexander MacDonald Thomson attributed a steep rise in the number of floggings in the Gaol between 1891 and 1895 to a misuse of the cranks:

>About September last year, in the course of my usual inspections, I came to the
conclusion that the head turnkey was not doing his duty and that the cranks were
not up to the proper strength. I ordered the warder to make a surprise test of all
the cranks immediately on receipt of the head turnkey’s certificate. One morning,
in doing so, he found that most of the cranks were very much under weight—
under test—and a large proportion of them had no weight at all . . . the result of
that was that all the cranks being up to the proper test, the prisoners, as I believed,
entered into a conspiracy to refuse to do the labour, and the result was a large
increase in the number of floggings.20

Well established in 19th-century England, the crank was considered by penologists to be doubly fitting as a punishment: first, it was installed inside a cell and could therefore be worked by prisoners alone; secondly, if set at the right weight or pressure, the labour it extracted was systematic and measurable. In Hong Kong, for instance, men sentenced to penal labour in 1873 had to complete 14,000 revolutions a day, adjusted to ‘not exceeding 15,300’ turns in 1876, and further to 12,500 at a 12-pound pressure in subsequent years.

The punishment might have been measurable in terms of effort but individual experience of the degree of harshness was more difficult to gauge. To Chinese prisoners, the 1877 Gaol Committee observed, oakum-picking was the most laborious and disagreeable, while Europeans were particularly averse to the shot-drill. In 1887 a gaol administrator took a
contrary view, remarking that the crank was ‘much disliked by the Chinese to whom it is much more distasteful than shot drill or oakum picking’.[^6] José Rizal, the Filipino nationalist who visited Victoria Gaol in March 1892, left a vivid account of the crank in operation. The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell, Rizal noted, turning

>a leather-covered crank attached to the wall. This crank is connected to a
meter with a plate whose numbers indicate what should be done before
each meal. The room is dark. From outside can be seen the moving end
of the axis; there is an arrow indicating the direction. Every prisoner has
to walk back and forth 12,500 times a day and if he fails to do it, he will
be punished. The resistance weight of the crank is probably from 10 to 16
pounds. There is a book there in which are recorded the number of turns
one has made and the number of days that he has to work. It is hard work
and it is a pity that so much motive power is not employed in something
useful.[^7]

The shot-drill was equally unproductive: in fact it was impossible to imagine anything more ingeniously useless, an English social commentator remarked in 1862. But Lord Carnarvon and his 1863 committee on gaol discipline approved of this very uselessness, maintaining that the prisoner’s awareness of the futility of his exertions would add insult to injury and reinforce the punishment. Rizal also observed the shot-drill exercise in action: at a warder’s command, the prisoner had to bend and lift a heavy ‘shot’ or cannonball with both hands, take a few paces, and then put it down. Shots were 18, 24 or 32 pounds in weight. The prisoner then repeated the action—again and again for four hours, in spells of half an hour at a time, with stone-carrying or oakum-picking during the intervals. The stone-carrying was a local version of an endurance test: it involved the prisoner walking around the yard with two large pieces of granite (total load of about 45 pounds) suspended from a bamboo pole placed across the shoulders.
