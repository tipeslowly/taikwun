All inhabitants of Hong Kong, regardless of race, rank, or nationality, came within the jurisdiction of the magistrates. From the late 19th century most new laws were framed without distinction according to race. However, during the early colonial period the criminal justice system, particularly at the magistracy level, was systematically biased against Chinese and other non-Europeans. Many of Hong Kong’s early laws, explicitly or by operation, applied only to the Chinese population.

Magistrates tended to distrust Chinese evidence, particularly where it was given against respectable Europeans. Chinese and other Asians were more likely to go to gaol for non-payment of fines. Chinese alone were subjected to flogging, exposure in the stocks, and other forms of corporal punishment. Treated as outsiders with no stake in the colony, many faced extra-judicial penalties, such as deportation, in addition to punishments imposed by magistrates and judges. When civil unrest occurred, the government enacted draconian laws which fell heavily and indiscriminately on Chinese inhabitants and usually remained on the statute books long after the crisis had subsided.

In the early years of British rule, punishments for certain crimes included cutting off Chinese offenders’ queues. The queue—a long plait of hair at the back of the head, worn with a half-shaven crown—was both a mark of identity, even a status symbol, among Chinese males and a sign of allegiance to Qing rule. Its absence was a sign of outlawry punishable by death. In 1842 many respectable Chinese threatened to leave the colony if this degrading punishment was not abolished. After controversy in Parliament it was discontinued as a judicial punishment. In the Gaol, long-term prisoners still had their queues cut off, but this was done on ‘health and cleanliness’ grounds, not as a punishment, and they were usually given time to regrow their hair before release.

Some early Chinese offenders were exposed in public places in the cangue or ‘Chinese stocks’, a portable wooden board in which the head was secured, preventing the wearer from eating or moving freely. This appears to have been used in Hong Kong only in the early 1840s for certain minor offences, including failure to produce a ticket of registration. One of the first people to have been convicted by the Supreme Court, the woman Laong Kwok-shi, was sentenced in October 1844 to be exhibited monthly in the cangue, in addition to her 18-month prison sentence for kidnapping two boatwomen with the aim of selling them into prostitution. This was the only ‘Chinese punishment’ ever to be imposed by Hong Kong’s Supreme Court: the home government objected to the vague powers given to the early Supreme Court to punish Chinese offenders ‘according to the laws of China’, and instructed the Governor to remove them.

**Flogging**

In the early 1840s the Magistracy under William Caine routinely imposed flogging on the buttocks with a rattan cane for all forms of crime committed by Chinese offenders, in addition to short prison sentences. Serious cases of piracy, robbery or burglary had to be sent to the Governor or his deputy for sentencing. In a typical case in January 1844 Governor Pottinger sentenced nine pirates each to five years’ imprisonment with hard labour, with the further direction that each of the prisoners shall receive 100 strokes during each year of their confinement within the 1st and 6th months on such day as the Chief Magistrate may appoint; that they shall stand in the Pillory (Cangue) for an hour on each occasion before they are flogged with labels on their breasts descriptive of their crime and sentence; that at the expiration of the full period of imprisonment they shall be turned off the island and warned if they are ever again found in the Colony they will be confined for life.[^1]

As the colony’s criminal justice system became more regulated, limits were imposed by legislation both on the number of strokes in each case and at each flogging (usually 36 or 50) and to the offences to which it could be applied. Practices varied over the years. In the mid-19th century offences punishable by flogging included larceny, assault, stealing from the person, being a rogue and vagabond, indecent exposure, obeying the call of nature in a public place, begging, malicious injury to property, gambling, riotous assembly, belonging to the Triad Society, returning from deportation, and other miscellaneous offences.

In the early 1860s, on instructions from the Colonial Office and against strong objections from officials in Hong Kong, the punishment was mainly restricted to repeat offenders, and robbery and other crimes involving violence. On 7 January 1867, for example, during a wave of violent crime, Wong Ayow, ‘calling himself a cook’, was sentenced by the Magistrate J.C. Whyte to six months’ imprisonment and two floggings for his part in a gang attack on a Chinese man near the Sing-ping Theatre on Hollywood Road, in which a hat was stolen. The next day he was led out of the Gaol ‘with a board on his chest and back stating the nature of his offence, his head clean shaved, and carrying the foxes with which he was to be lashed and the cat which would shortly cut into his back’. He was then ‘lashed to the nearest convenient lamp-post and received thirty lashes as the first instalment of his punishment’.[^2]

The Magistrate Charles May insisted the punishment was necessary for a wide range of crimes. ‘It has become known to me from experience,’ he wrote, ‘that Chinese offenders have a wholesome dread of flogging, and that imprisonment is not regarded with apprehension . . . in fact corporal punishment is the only efficacious method of restraining crime.’[^3] By the 1870s, however, magistrates, including Charles May, were more sparing in their use of flogging. The punishment had been introduced into the Supreme Court in 1865 and continued to be widely inflicted.

While magistrates imposed canings on the buttocks, the Supreme Court could order up to three public whippings with the cat-o’-nine-tails on the back, to a maximum of 50 lashes on each occasion (25 strokes of the rattan if the offender was under 16), in addition to a sentence of penal servitude. Forty-eight offenders received between them 4,956 lashes under this provision during the first six months of its operation. Until the government cleared the area in late 1844 to make way for European settlement, early floggings were usually carried out at a public whipping stand in the Upper Bazaar, a Chinese commercial district (centred on today’s Graham Street) close to the Magistracy.

The windows and balconies of the houses surrounding the whipping post were packed with spectators, male and female, who ‘seemed to consider the whole thing as quite an entertainment’. Immediately in front of the ‘post of dishonour’ a crowd of ‘high government officials, justices, barristers, naval and military officers, bankers, merchants &c., &c.’ had gathered to witness the ‘writhing and howling under the awful torture of the lash, and to count the “thuds”’. The Colonial Surgeon was in attendance to prevent the infliction of greater punishment than the men could bear, and two or three were released before they had received the assigned number of lashes. The floggings were administered by ‘four powerful fellows, who exhibited quite sufficient dexterity in the use of the whip as to justify their appointment to the position which they hold’.[^4]

Flogging was applied to males only. From the 1860s on, no formal distinction was made according to race. In practice, however, before World War II magistrates and judges did not sentence Europeans to flogging. The only exceptions appear to have been in 1866, when in the Supreme Court the judge Henry Ball imposed sentences of flogging on an American sailor convicted of wounding, and a Polish ex-policeman convicted of robbery from a Chinese woman. The sentences provoked outrage in the colonial community and were not carried out.[^5] Equal justice for all men was healthy enough at home, a petition on behalf of one of the men argued, but the Chinese had no conception of equal justice, and the public flogging of a European in the presence of the Chinese would bring disgrace to the whole European community.[^6]

Besides its use as a judicial punishment, flogging was one of several disciplinary measures available within Victoria Gaol for offences under the prison regulations such as mutiny, assault, indecent or disorderly behaviour, idleness and wilful damage. Floggings took place with far greater frequency than in prisons in England: in the five years up to July 1876, for example, over a thousand corporal punishments were imposed on prisoners in Hong Kong, compared with about 5,000 in England, which had a population 170 times the size of Hong Kong. The widespread imposition of flogging in prison and by the courts shocked the liberal-minded Governor, Sir John Pope Hennessy, when he arrived in Hong Kong in 1877. ‘As far as I am aware,’ he said, ‘there is no code of laws in any part of Her Majesty’s Empire in which the power of flogging is so extensively given to Magistrates and Judges as in Hong Kong.’ He added,

>the ostentatious marching of the prisoners half naked through the crowded streets
and the public exhibition of an English turnkey flogging with a vigorous arm the
speedily bleeding body of a Chinaman, tied to the whipping post, is not calculated
to do much good to the groups of neglected little children who flock to see
it, and to the great majority of whom this spectacle is the only lesson they receive
from the civilized Government under which they have been born.[^7]

Hennessy abolished all flogging, except for offences for which it was available in England—for example, robbery with violence, and attempts to choke, suffocate or strangle (imposed only by the Supreme Court), and larceny by a male offender who appeared to be under the age of 16. Nevertheless, after his departure, flogging gradually crept back into the statute book for other offences, and whipping with the cat-o’-nine-tails, to which he was strongly averse, was not ended until 1954.
