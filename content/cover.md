Standing together on a hillside above Hong Kong harbour, at the very centre of the city, the Central Police
Station, Central Magistracy, and Victoria Gaol occupy an entire block of Hollywood Road. Until they were eventually dwarfed by modern high-rise developments, this complex was an ominous presence that loomed over Hong Kong's lower slopes for many decades.

[*Crime, Justice and Punishment in Colonial Hong Kong*](https://hkupress.hku.hk/pro/1640.php) is a history of these three institutions through a cross section of the people, the buildings in which they found themselves, and the settings in which they pursued their various activities. Covering multiple perspectives, the people and their stories remain at the narrative’s centre, as the timeline zigzags from the colonisation of Hong Kong in 1841 to 2005–2006, when the three buildings were decommissioned.

In 2006, when its last occupants moved out, the Central Police Station complex began a new life as a conservation and revitalisation project under the sponsorship of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. After a period of repair and restoration, and with the addition of two new structures, the 16 existing buildings, and the compound in which they cluster, were transformed into a centre for art, heritage and leisure. A place of retribution, redemption, and death—now opened up to the public’s gaze—transformed into a space for edification and entertainment—the heritage and arts centre known as Tai Kwun.
