The two-storey Magistracy building was H-shaped, with the vestibule and main entrance facing west into an internal courtyard, beyond which was the Gaol. On the opposite side a veranda looked out over Arbuthnot Road. A 19th-century photograph of the surrounding area shows the upper floor of the building and its central veranda between two end bays that were surmounted by pediments. The Chief Magistrate’s court took up the centre of the building.

A smaller room on the second storey of one of the bays was used by the Assistant Magistrate (later, the Second Magistrate). Other rooms were reserved for the Chief Magistrate’s private office, witnesses and prisoners, and the usher, clerks and records. In the early days public hangings, visible from Arbuthnot Road, took place in a yard next to the building. From very early on the building was found to be inadequate. In the main court, because of the great height of the room in proportion to its length, the acoustics were so poor that all sound was lost, so that it was nearly impossible to hear the examination of witnesses even close up.[^1]

The Chief Magistrate, Henry Tudor Davies, complained in 1857 that proceedings were frequently disturbed by the noise of crowds collecting under the vestibule, the only place for them to gather even though it offered little protection from the sun or rain. Often there was insufficient space for prisoners in the courts: on several occasions, Davies pointed out, he had tried more than 20 prisoners in the same case—once as many as 75, and at another time 95. The building had no facilities for keeping witnesses separate from each other, and no cells for prisoners awaiting trial. Trials in the main court were constantly interrupted by clerks passing from their offices to the smaller court upstairs. Cases frequently had to be adjourned ‘on account of the supposed absence of material witnesses, when they were within the precincts of the Court, but owing to the defective accommodation not easily found; such adjournments were a serious detriment to the cause of justice, where, as in this Colony, they are immediately taken advantage of for getting up false Evidence.’[^2]

The Magistrate’s Bench in the main courtroom was a mere table—semi-circular with a cloth top listed in an inventory compiled in 1861—with chairs for the Magistrate, any justices who might be present, and others considered privileged enough to sit with the Magistrate: sometimes a visiting Chinese official seeking the extradition of an alleged offender, the Attorney General or other members of the legal profession, a missionary giving evidence or the Governor on an official visit. Prominent or respectable Europeans, like Albert Smith, were also sometimes given a place beside the Magistrate, even in some cases when they were appearing as defendants. The Bench was separated from the rest of the court by railings, near to which there were tables and chairs for interpreters, the usher and the press. Members
of the public were accommodated on chairs (for Europeans) and wooden benches (for others). These arrangements seem to have continued for the rest of the 19th century. A description in one of the newspapers from 1898 observed that:

>there is not a more wretchedly-lighted, ill-designed, and badly-ventilated Police
Court in all the British colonies. The room is abominably dirty, the ceilings are
festooned with cobwebs, and a fitting legend to place over the door of the place
would be that which Dante described as adorning the portals of the nether regions.
The dock is frequently crowded with prisoners, some in very advanced stages of
disease and filthiness, and just about two feet away is the one solitary table that
has to do duty for counsel, press and police officers. It frequently happens that
there is no room in the dock for all the day’s prisoners and then the ‘overflow
congregation’ is jammed in between the dock rails and the backs of the chairs of
the solicitors and reporters. The close proximity of, say, twenty or thirty people
taken from a fantan ‘school’ is not a comforting thing and several men of law have
gone to much inconvenience rather than endure the contiguity. Then also there is
the dense throng of Chinese that fill the rear part of the room. They are generally
idlers of the coolie class who come to kill time, and many of them bring loud and
unpleasant evidence of pulmonary troubles.11

Generally, the article concluded, the court was ‘as badly adapted for its purposes as it can possibly be.’ Another description from the same year described it as ‘not a particularly nice place . . . and the people who frequent it are even less nice.’

In the long narrow railed-in enclosure called the dock each morning is packed the heterogeneous crowd of rogues and vagabonds, thieves, disorderly ones, gamblers and so forth that the English, Indian, and Chinese police have roped in since the Court rose on the previous day. They are young and old, many in rags that fail to cover their nakedness and many of them too are in a deplorably filthy state. A few feet away from the dock are the tables for officers, counsel, and the press representatives, and behind the dock is the place for the public. All the unemployed coolies in the Colony seem to make it their duty to fill this space each day and an unsavoury lot they are. On a warm day the atmosphere fairly reeks with the vile exudations from the crowd and the case is not improved by the constant ‘hawking’ and expectorating that goes on. As each prisoner’s case is called on he stands up in the dock, hears the evidence against
him through the interpreter, says what he has to say or calls his witnesses, and if adjudged guilty the constable in charge leads him out by the queue to the little waiting room where he stays until the committal order is made out, and then he disappears behind that great iron-barred gate a few yards off. There must be an enormous illicit opium trade done in the Colony judging by the number of trays, pipes, scales and horn boxes filled with the drug that are constantly on the tables as exhibits. It is fearfully odorous at times and makes one wish to be out in the fresh air soon, especially when there happens to be a well-seasoned pipe in evidence.
